By surmounting inherent flaws that plague other products, VMRay Analyzer has become the gold standard for malware sandboxing among leading DFIR teams worldwide.    The core of the VMRay Platform is an agentless, hypervisor-based sandbox, which is unique in combining near-total evasion resistance with full visibility into malware behavior: a trait we call X-Ray Vision. Because nothing touches or modifies the analysis environment, monitoring is invisible, and even the most evasive malware strains fully execute in the sandbox. By monitoring every interaction between malware and the target system, VMRay captures a complete and accurate record of threat behavior – data that enriches detection, incident response, digital forensics, and threat intelligence.  VMRay Intelligent Monitoring excels over other solutions in distinguishing between malicious behavior and legitimate activity.

The result is the worldwide unique CorTec Brain Interchange™ System. The platform technology will enable researchers and clinicians to develop novel therapies for neurological diseases. Laser-structured °AirRay™ electrode arrays provide a reliable interface for permanent brain recordings. Being very soft and flexible, they allow for easy implantation and gently fit to the curvature of the brain.  A biocompatible ceramic encapsulation hermetically encloses an implanted electronics unit that preprocesses the data. A key component of this system is a custom-made microchip (ASIC) developed in cooperation with the Institute of Microelectronics at the University of Ulm (Prof. Maurits Ortmanns). It amplifies neuronal signals in many independent channels (currently 32) and digitizes them at high sampling rate (currently 1 kHz) while, at the same time, allowing for swift and flexible switching between recording and stimulation mode. Thanks to an inductive power supply via an external unit, it also works without a battery. This eliminates the need for surgical replacement when battery power decreases (as is still the case in many of today’s implantable systems). Via the same external unit, brain signals are transmitted wirelessly to a Computer Unit for processing. CorTec is also providing support, services and components of the Brian Interchange System such as AirRay Electrodes, encapsulation technology, overmolding technology and device assemply to Medtech Companies and start up in the field of neurotechnology.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Software",5,51-100,"Christina Schwartz, Jorn Rickert, Martin Schuttler, Thomas Stieglitz, Wolfgang Meier",6,Late Stage Venture,2022-12-19,,,,Grant,13000000,EUR,14248761,Series C,23200000,EUR,26933734,25700000,EUR,29411700,"High-Tech Gruenderfonds, European Innovation Council, KfW, Santo Venture Capital, LBBW VC",3,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

IPlytics is the first solution on the market to bring together comprehensive, highly indexed global patent data, declared standard essential patents, patent pools and standards contribution data, to provide industry-leading analysis on the past, present and future of technology. Unlike other tools that are overly complex, IPlytics provides fast, intuitive access to patents and standards to empower the user to strategically align patent portfolios to protect innovations and proactively engage in continuous strategic portfolio development as it relates to SEP assets, for initiatives such as licensing, acquisitions and joining patent pools, or to understand the respective positions of the competition. The next technology revolution will connect everything making it even more challenging to understand how technologies and IP rights overlap. IP professionals need to rethink – even revolutionize – how to approach both patent and standards data, to provide business-ready insights for actionable decision making across the organization. IPlytics Platform adds value in a scenario in which technology or intellectual property management teams are short-staffed and have time constrains and budgetary limits in gaining access to multiple databases for their analyses and strategic conclusions.

Today, a team of over 40 oncologists, scientists, and developers, together with an extensive network, are working to improve the quality of cancer care by translating the latest research into therapy algorithms. The precise, guideline-compliant therapy recommendations (including Best Clinical Practice) are qualitatively assured and individually support the decision on the optimal therapy for each individual patient. This allows, based on the evidence obtained, to measure oncological care and to return real treatment data to research. At Onqo, we believe that by combining science and technology, we can significantly reduce misdiagnosis rates - by providing the relevant information to the right people at the right time. EasyOncology is a Decision Support System for solid tumors and, with approximately 6,000 downloads, it's now the leading app for oncology professionals. This certified medical product presents the standards for diagnostics, therapy planning, and follow-up care in a very clear and concise manner, making it intuitive, quick, and goal-oriented. Users are guided from question to answer in less than five clicks. Unlike other mediums, the stage-appropriate therapy recommendation is first given in a brief overview to quickly grasp the therapeutic principle. Depending on the information needed, this can be explored in more detail. The oncological action recommendations are continuously retrospectively matched with decisions from tumor boards and thus validated. This is collected as part of a scientific accompanying program. From this, the idea developed to offer this system as an interface (API) for tumor board software, in order to reduce the high number of cases discussed in the tumor boards. This way, they can be quantitatively relieved and have more time available for complex cases. After entering all relevant information into the tumor board request, Board Support immediately generates a therapy recommendation. Standard cases with therapy recommendations no longer need to be presented at the board or can be consented in advance. Significant insights regarding the efficiency of therapies, the quality of treatments, etc., are obtained from the accompanying usage data. Board Support is currently in the pilot phase. onqo is a digital companion for NSCLC patients, supporting them on their journey with individualized, evidence-based, and comprehensible information for optimal oncological care. An interactive query allows for the personalized provision of information on the treatment course, including event-related notifications. This empowers patients to better understand their own illness, comprehend why certain therapeutic decisions are made, and recognize, based on the latest medical findings, the optimal treatment for their individual situation. onqo promotes guideline-compliant treatment by determining the right next steps based on previous user responses and highlighting deviations from these. onqo provides a summary of the collected information to present at the next doctor's appointment. To always have all important information in one place, findings or doctor's letters can be saved in the app, as well as questions and notes. Additionally, onqo offers valuable knowledge about cancer, covering all relevant medical topics, but also accompanying subjects like exercise, financial security, or dealing with stress. Additionally, onqo provides valuable knowledge about cancer, covering all relevant medical topics, as well as accompanying subjects like exercise, financial security, or stress management. In aftercare, onqo regularly asks about important general symptoms that can be summarized in the next treatmentdiscussion as soon as a significant change is detected.","Health Care, Software",1,11-50,Thomas Elter,1,Seed,2023-08-22,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,"Bertelsmann Investments, Isartal Ventures",,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

C2Call GmbH,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/c2call,Active,,"Messaging, Mobile, VoIP","Werl, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany",C2Call develops mobile and browser-based voice and video calling solutions for the computing cloud.,"1,692,470","European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",59457,Less than $1M,2008-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.c2call.com,http://twitter.com/C2Call_GmbH,http://www.facebook.com/c2call.sdk,https://www.linkedin.com/company/c2call-gmbh,"**About** C2Call GmbH leads the way in introducing next generation mobile and browser-based calling solutions for the computing cloud. FriendCaller for iOS and Android are built using C2Call SDK, and demonstrate the unique capabilities to establish a peer-to-peer connection with any mobile platform and with any Internet browser without prerequisite software installations. With the new C2Call SDK, developers would now be able to integrate features alike FriendCaller in their existing or new apps on mobile. **How it began** As the founders and architects of Actai Networks (Singapore, Germany and Taiwan) a mobile Internet solutions development company, Martin Feuerhahn and Michael Knecht experienced firsthand the diversified environments in terms of operating systems, standards, languages and regional preferences while traveling and communicating with customers worldwide. All existing VoIP solutions were closed user group systems and required users to install software, register and exchange ID before a call was possible.   **A Striking Idea** Feuerhahn and Knecht decided to create a solution that initiates instantly in any popular browser overcoming all the obstacles which the existing VoIP technologies were up against – including the requirements for both call parties to register and exchange IDs. C2Call is the result: This simple-to-use click-to-call VoIP technology works across diversified environments such as Windows, Mac and Linux, yet easily spans foreign languages and standards globally – with no software or hardware installation required prior to use. Unlike installed clients that easily take upto 50 to 75MB of memory, C2Call does not “hog” memory. C2Call packs the VoIP functionality in a small, temporary 750kb Java applet.   FriendCaller.com, powered by C2Call In February 2009, less than one year after start up, the C2Call-powered FriendCaller.com website was released to demonstrate C2Call’s unique capabilities in the Social Networking Space, offering a 100 percent web-based alternative to installed VoIP services such as Skype, MSN, AIM and others.   **FriendCaller** can be used to call other FriendCaller users but breaks the “closed system” open with the patent pending Callme links. Callme links connect instantly to anyone on the Internet, whether he or she is a FriendCaller user or not. Callme links can be sent via email, instant message or can be placed on social media profiles and blogs, starting in any popular browser.   **FriendCaller App for iOS** The FriendCaller apps for iOS (iPhone, iPod touch and iPad) prove that the original Java-based C2Call technology can be easily ported to other platforms. FriendCaller app for iOS turns the iPhone in a full-fledged WiFi/3G Video VoIP phone. Since the iPhone iOS does not support Java, a native client was developed with the same capabilities of sending universal instant CallMe links that can be opened by any PC browser. The Apple-approved FriendCaller iPhone app can be downloaded on iTunes and works with the original iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3Gs, iPod touch and iPad (1st and 2nd generation). FriendCaller Video Chat is best suited for iPhone4, iOS 5 or later. After successful and clean results of video calling seen on larger retina display of iPhone 5 and iPod touch, C2Call has recently introduced HD video chat for the new iPad as well. Making 7- way video calling experience ultimately sublime for its users in HD!   Comparing C2Call with Skype, AIM, QQ, etc.: The developers of C2Call have created a sensational, unique new product that transcends current VoIP technologies such as Skype, AIM and all others. These services operate only in a “closed system” mode, where communicating parties must install the same software, then exchange user IDs prior to making a connection and speaking. The closed system can never be an “instant” connection. C2Call is an “open” system that instantly provides peer-to-peer communication due to its capability to send the Callme links.   Calling Out to the World The FriendCaller website and iPhone users can add call credits to their accounts and call out to the telephone networks of more than 400 countries and territories worldwide. Most phone numbers in popular destinations in North America, Europe and Asia can be called for only 2 cents per minute. Calls are charged by the minute, and no additional “connection fee” or “call set-up fees” apply.   **Ready to Grow** The FriendCaller website and all call servers are hosted on Amazon Web services. This cloud computing setup allows full scalability for growth as well as for business applications and support thousands of apps, not only FriendCaller. **SDK launched** With the launch of our SDK for mobile app developers, C2Call is providing access to the “one-click” video calling, voice and messaging functionality, which was only previously available through FriendCaller. By integrating C2Call’s technology into their mobile apps, developers will now be able to have their users communicate across multiple apps, on different platforms using rich communication functionalities. **Bottom-line advantage** Instant calling – worldwide! It doesn’t matter what VoIP software or browser a user has – or if there is any software at all! Users simply click on the link in the email signature of the person requesting a call. Without any software installation , C2Call provides VoIP to begin an instant connection in a browser.    **Investors** C2Call GmbH was funded in April 2008 by Martin Feuerhahn and Michael Knecht. One month later it received already international angel funding. Its group of angel investors includes Michael Brehm, former executive director of StudiVZ , Europe’s largest social networking site and Tapesh Sinha, Founder of Acctel Group of companies. In October 2009 the High-Tech Gründerfonds became the lead investor. The High-Tech Gründerfonds is Germany leading start-up venture capital group and is itself backed by six of Germany's largest industrial groups including BASF, Deutsche Telekom, Siemens, Robert Bosch, Daimler and Carl Zeiss.

Offering easy-to-use, cost-effective VoIP calling, FriendCaller allows users to instantly connect over the Internet through the company’s patented Callme links.
