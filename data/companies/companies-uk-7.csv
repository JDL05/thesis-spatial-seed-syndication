This means putting candidates first — not companies. Today we're focused on building the better way to find a fulfilling job in tech. In the future, we'll help people find jobs at all of the best companies. Looking for a job is a frustrating experience. It's incredibly hard to find a good match. Job adverts lack useful information like salary and diversity data. Companies sometimes never respond. There’s a lack of friendly-support in those tough moments of rejection … the list goes on. When starting Otta, we saw that candidates are often treated as second-class citizens. So we set out to build a candidate-first job search: one that is laser-focused on providing the best experience for candidates. There’s a big market to go after in recruitment, with LinkedIn selling over $10bn/year of recruitment products. But it’s impossible to battle a giant like LinkedIn if you try and compete on all jobs from Day 1. So we chose tech companies as our first move. As we grow, we’ll expand into other industries to help more people find fulfillment. Since launching in Jan 2020, we’ve grown from 1,000 applications sent per month to multiple thousands sent every day, across the UK & US. Otta is becoming a must-have for companies, and this puts us in a strong position to demand a better experience for candidates.

Now I have it, I’m in love with it. I am in project management, so on top of managing myself I have to manage a lot of others. While I have to-do systems such as Trello and Asana, most of those to-dos are spurred from emails (or an email that has a lot of information)."" ""I’ve tried setting up folders and didn’t work. It made it so hard until now. Drag, simply put, is awesome. I can now run my inbox like I do my tasks inside Trello.” “We’ve previously used tools such as Wunderlist, Asana, Evernote, Todoist, Any.do, Trello and Sortd however they’re all focused on managing Tasks inside a tool. I need to manage my tasks inside my email. Booooom, then Drag came a long. Honestly, it’s the most productive Chrome extension I’ve used in years. Thanks Drag, I’m an official Dragster now!” “Email is the perennial problem for me, because I want to use it as a todo list, but I also want a zero inbox. I’m a huge fan of Trello, it is the most productive workspace I have today.  So when I saw Drag, the light went on and I am now unable to live without it.” “We’ve tried them all from Trello, Asana, Evernote through to Sortd and others. Drag complements my use of Trello perfectly. I don’t want all Tasks inside Trello so to run my Gmail separately works amazingly well.” How does Drag compare to other tools?  If you’re considering what Task Management or Project Management tools you should be using in your spare time and improve what you’re doing, there’s a lot of options.  From regular old spreadsheets to manage Tasks to specific Kanban boards of software, sales and marketing. There are dozens of solutions (we love Trello) and Drag works perfectly with them. Don’t replace your main tools, instead use Drag to apply the same principles of being efficient with tasks, inside your inbox.  www.dragapp.com ","Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Software",2,11-50,"Eduarda Bardavid, Nick Timms",3,Seed,2021-02-01,2000000,BRL,368141,Seed,2000000,BRL,368141,Seed,488141,USD,488141,488141,USD,488141,"Techstars, The Future Fund, Aerion Partners, Gvangels, Florian Hagenbuch",2,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

This ambitious community-led project will help preserve the character of the town and protect jobs in family-run High Street shops as well as creating much needed homes. This project is supported by the Brecon Beacons National Parks Sustainable Development Fund, and Powys’s EU LEADER Development Programme. The Corn Exchange project is being run by Corn Exchange Crickhowell Ltd (CECLtd) – a small company which was established in December 2015 to enable the community buyout of the former pub. More than 230 local people and friends of Crickhowell have invested in Corn Exchange Crickhowell Ltd – to stop the building being turned into a supermarket.

Why use C-CAS?  Children are great, no question but early years and school-age childcare is expensive.  The C-CAS scheme helps to make childcare more affordable and easier to manage.   What exactly is C-CAS? The scheme is essentially an online account, mobile app and marketplace.  Employers can support their employees by providing an interest-free 12-month loan, which is paid in to their online account, to then be used specifically for childcare costs. Can everyone use C-CAS?  Yes.  Whilst the scheme has been developed as a voluntary employee benefit, you can still use the scheme, even if your employer doesn’t offer C-CAS as a benefit. How long does the loan last?  The interest-free loan is to be repaid over a maximum of 12 months, but the money does not need to be used within the year, which means you can build up a balance to pay for all those unexpected childcare costs. What can I use the loan for?  The scheme can be used with Ofsted (or equivalent) registered childcare providers or companies/organisations who provide childcare activities, such as after-school & holiday clubs, sports & activity clubs, as well as tutors, which gives parents significant flexibility.  How easy is it to use? From the minute the loan-sum lands in your account, you will be able to choose, book and pay for all of your childcare services from the very same digital portal.  We have endeavoured to put the emphasis on simplicity; ‘One Payment. One Portal. One Solution’. How can I find out further information about C-CAS?
