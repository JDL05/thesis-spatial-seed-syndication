The company's first product is noc™ - a video communication tool, scientifically designed to minimise the cognitive effort of context-switching between tasks and calls. By minimising the cognitive load on the human brain, users are able to communicate more naturally whilst maintaining focus on their current task. This results in reduced mental exhaustion (""Zoom fatigue""), fewer incidences of miscommunication, improved productivity, innovation, and staff retention. The product also uses natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to summarise conversational content and deliver live, unbiased operational data to business leaders. After a call, the NLP transcript is compressed by the AI into a bullet-pointed summary of the conversation. For larger companies, the AI compresses all conversation data to present a live operational dashboard to senior leadership, helping them make more informed decisions. The company has been awarded grant funding by the EU's Regional Development Fund and Innovate UK's Transformative Technologies Fund for research into the effects of remote communication on mental health, productivity and innovation, as well as its contribution towards net zero carbon emissions by reducing the demand for travel. The product was created by thought-leading user experience designers, MBA graduates and PhD neuroscientists from Cranfield University, The University of Bristol and University College London to fill a gap in the remote comms market for instant, casual communication with distant colleagues. It uses a unique peer-to-peer network architecture that bypasses data centres for a faster, clearer and more energy-efficient connection.","Administrative Services, Content and Publishing, Design, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Science and Engineering, Software, Video",4,1-10,"Frances Eida-Miles, Frances Knight, Kiran Mann, Rory Watts",1,Seed,2023-06-01,141000,GBP,176621,Pre-Seed,141000,GBP,176621,Pre-Seed,141000,GBP,176621,141000,GBP,176621,"Innovate UK, JR Cap, Rory Watts, William Aitken",2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
