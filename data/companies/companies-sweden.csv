This gives the consumer an incentive to recycle the package.

Our solution can be connected to all sorts of packaging – everything from plastic bags to take-away mugs to products.

Bower® is a mobile app that enables consumer brands to put a deposit value on their packaging – either in the form of money or points. By doing so, they take a greater responsibility for their packaging and, at the same time, get a direct relationship to their end-consumers through the app. To create a deposit system is simpler than it sounds.

Release the Power. Digitalization quickly accelerates energy consumption. In 2030, the ICT (Information and Communications Technology) sector is projected to stand for more than one-fifth of the global electricity demand. Maximizing performance per watt in servers and smart devices is critical to breaking the trend. ZeroPoint technology delivers up to 50% more performance per watt by removing unnecessary information from microchips in data centers (CPU) and smart devices (SoC), meaning that:  •	Data centers can maximize performance and reduce energy consumption.  •	Smart device developers can maximize performance and user experience without compromising on battery life. Typical memory contains up to 70% unnecessary information. ZeroPoint technology removes all this information by combining ultra-fast data compression with realtime data compaction and transparent memory management. Integrating these three areas into one solution for maximizing performance per watt makes us unique.  ZeroPoint is the result of decades of frontline research and in-depth technical knowledge. We have a strong patent portfolio and a pipeline of ideas related to our core business. ZeroPoint delivers a hardware IP block that customers integrate on their SoC. We work closely with industry-leading companies in product implementation projects targeting the most advanced technology nodes available. The Technology, ideas and many of the people behind and with ZeroPoint comes from Professor Per Stenström’s research group, which is internationally recognized for excellence within high-performance computing.

Swedish Adrenaline became by doing so a holding company. Innowearable is devoted to Sport Electronics and Raytelligence is focused on microwave sensors for the healthcare- and industrial markets.   In 2015 Raytelligence received a grant from the Swedish Innovation Bureau - Vinnova to develop a radar sensor for vital sign monitoring.   Raytelligence showed in 2016 the first version of the 60 GHz sensor for vital sign monitoring and also a cloud service was demonstrated.   In 2017 the sensor RayVS1 was certified for home use. This year the first industrial client was signed for development and delivery of sensors to the road construction market as well as signing a partnership with a major Swedish IT-provider to the e-Health market.

We offer simple, reliable, and sustainable services for the everyday cyclist who are looking for a more convenient and functioning bicycle life. MIOO contributes to sustainable and healthy cities by enabling billions of kilometers of mobility by pure pedal power! MARKET Cycling is growing rapidly with 2B bikes in the world and +100M sold bikes per year. Bicycle commuting is exploding in large cities through new bike lanes, healthier lifestyles and environmental consciousness. Copenhagen and Amsterdam have close to  50% mobility by bicycle. Paris, London and Stockholm are quickly catching up from 10% levels. Cycling delivers several 100 times more mobility in kilometers than all E-scooters and other mobility companies all together.  IMPACT Bikes are the most efficient, sustainable and healthy way of transportation up to 30km and it is an effective solution for several global challenges. A bicycle emits only 3g of CO2 per km. An everyday cyclist shows a 40% lower mortality risk. PROBLEM  Bicycle sales are moving online. The 20% CAGR of online sales before Covid-19 is now accelerating fast, expected to reach 40% of all sales in many countries by 2025. The shift to online sales requires new types of solutions for customer support and service of the bike. Customers wait on average 12 days to get the bike fixed and even finding a nearby bike repair shop is hard. Millions of bicycles are left in sheds or garages with simpler problems. Millions of bicycles are also reported stolen and rarely get back to the owners even if the Police finds it. People stop biking due to this, leaving all the impacts disabled.  SOLUTION MIOO offers a solution to all this by establishing a  “service & safety” relationship with the user from when the bicycle is unpacked from a delivery box until the bike is sold. PRODUCT / APP - Bicycle service where you are - Assemble your newly online-purchased bike at your doorstep  - Anti theft registration and Bike-id-labeling - Bicycle insurance  - Service book  - Digital and secure change of ownership - IoT ready for Smart locks and GPS - Service and Safety subscription single or family plan BUSINESS MODEL On-demand services act as profitable funnel into a recurring subscriptions 100€ in yearly recurring revenues per user from subscriptions and on-demand sales of service and safety.
