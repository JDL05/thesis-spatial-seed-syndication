Considering only construction megaprojects, this sector is moving around 7 trillion $ a year. And following their previsions, megaprojects are going to grow a 109% in the next 10 years.  It is extremely huge. So, it is absolutely incoherent that 1200 construction workers die a year only in the Qatar market. It is threatening that construction supervisor is the #9 most dangerous job in the world. And also, it does not make sense that with this giant market, almost the 98% of the megaprojects in the world finish their tasks overbudget and overtime nowadays. To help construction projects, their designing and planification are increasing the adoption of the BIM methodology. The Building Information Modeling is revolutionizing the construction sector and it is planned to be used in the 98% of the megaprojects in the next 5 years. So CHECKTOBUILD is born based in two fundamental pillars: These necessities that we have explained and the big opportunity that BIM represents. CHECKTOBUILD is a construtech startup that provides an autonomous inspection service and business intelligence for big construction projects. We do it integrating BIM models, that the construction companies must develop, with IoT and drone`s sytems by a software platform. In four simple steps, CHECKTOBUILD workflow is: -	You upload the BIM model to the software platform. -	Drones take photos of the construction execution step by step and send them to the platform. -	The software platform creates an equivalent and real model to BIM with the drone’s photos and it compares them. -	You receive a complete documentation, business intelligence and alerts about the progress of the construction and the supervision results. We are focused in reducing wasted material, increasing inspection cost/time saving, reducing accidents in inspection services, provoking early error detection and creating a useful amount of real time data and new business intelligence. It is time to help the construction sector to grow in the terms of its importance in this 21st century market.

That means players’ performance directly affects the NFT face value (more about that below). Unlike some play-to-earn NFT-gamified/NFT-infused games, in Snook the players' in-game character IS an NFT, with your skill and gameplay achievements immutably recorded on chain. This snook-NFT, your game character, as long as it does not die, can be played in future games. It also retains value as a digital asset and collectible on the secondary market. Snook is the first game in a new NFT crypto-space – one that determines the face-value and affects the market value of NFTs through measurement of skilled ""work"" invested in their creation and development. It's a crypto meritocracy and similar to that thing your parents used to say: 'if you work hard and apply yourself, you'll reap the rewards'…  This merger between a relatively new, decentralized, trust-agnostic, and immutable economic paradigm and one of humanity’s most popular pass-time - gaming - is surprisingly natural and seamless. Players spend time playing. They develop skills with patience and persistence. Until today, their efforts were measured in their score, ranking and/or character evolution. Rewards were emotional and social. It felt good, and you got ""street cred"". However, like all economies, if one invests work/effort/energy in something, it should be possible to exchange the ""fruits"" of that labor with other things that also store value. Those could be money (e.g., Fiat or FT/cryptocurrencies), commodities (which are still fungible, i.e., they are the same and replacing one with another does not affect its value), or non-fungible items (e.g., NFTs). Which leads us to Snook – a game that allows players to monetize their performance and capture their unique gaming achievements in their NFTs.  Moreover, Snook makes certain achievements especially difficult to realize, allowing exceptional players to monetize their skill. As such, Snook is a steppingstone towards: As such, Snook is a steppingstone towards:  - Curtailing inflation in the NFT market by providing a value metric that is not only based on buzz and speculation. - Bringing the cryptocurrency and blockchain economy and ecosystem closer to mainstream economy and day-to-day transactions - Realizing a working model for capturing the value of skill and performance Whitepaper: https://whitepaper.snook.gg/","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Gaming, Other, Software",1,11-50,Hosam Mazawi,1,Seed,2020-09-01,3400000,USD,3400000,Pre-Seed,3400000,USD,3400000,Pre-Seed,3400000,USD,3400000,3400000,USD,3400000,"NGC Ventures, DAO Maker, Pluto Digital, MVST:MG, Maven Capital",1,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
