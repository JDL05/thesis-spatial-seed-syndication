When will the vehicle go out of charge? What is the optimal route? These are questions that arise every day when driving an EV. And these just get a lot worse if we are not talking about individual vehicles but 100s of them like electric van delivery fleets, public transport with e-buses or e-car company fleets. For them, electric vehicles are much more expensive and difficult to operate than normal petrol or diesel ones, not to mention the constant fear of running out of charge with 100s of vehicles at the same time. Volteum solves these issues for them every day. At Volteum our goal is to enable every company to use EVs as easily, effectively and economically as internal combustion engine vehicles. For this we are developing a software with which fleet operators can optimize their vehicles every day. The product has three main pillars: Firstly, we model and predict the energy consumption and the battery state of charge along the routes with our EV simulation engine. Secondly, based on this we plan optimal trips for the vehicles taking into account the charging needs, time, distance and costs as well. Thirdly, we also manage the daily tasks of the fleet and optimize their operation based on live data. With Volteum electric fleets save money as we optimize their fleet composition, the daily tasks, routes and the charging needs cost-effectively. They can also make sure none of the vehicles will go out of charge thanks to our simulation engine. Last but not least we save loads of human resources, manual calculations and planning with our algorithms. With this we can ensure that all tasks and routes will be covered just as easily and comfortably as with their old vehicles.","Software, Transportation, Travel and Tourism",3,11-50,"Dávid Kertész, Kornél Kálmán, Zsófia Tóth",2,Seed,2022-11-09,1250000,EUR,1252421,Seed,1250000,EUR,1252421,Seed,1372421,USD,1372421,1372421,USD,1372421,"Techstars, Day One Capital, Oktogon Ventures, Fiedler Capital, Jared Schrieber",2,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

In many sports, there are already a number of different Big Data based solutions, but in sailing there are not too many. Thus, so many questions can only be made based on feelings. At present, there is no any ready-to-go, easily accessible service and product on the market where users can access data about their sailing performance. Many large sailing electronics supplier companies have a wide portfolio of products designed for sailors, but none of them have the solution for data analysis. In a gradual way, with the new trends (Big Data, Artificial Intelligence), the demand for these types of technologies is grown in sailing sport. Compared to some other sports, sailing is still a bit behind - although it is a technical sport - but the first signs are just started to appear of this new approach. Like in any sport, you can name the so-called king categories, like Formula-1 for car racing. These events - without the need for completeness - are the Americas Cup, the Volvo Ocean Race, the Vendée Globe, the TP52 Series. In these competitions, all the time one dedicated person from the team works with data analysis and processing. Teams typically set up their own tools and procedures what they need to do because there are no players on the market to provide such services.

These solutions initially exert an excessive heat effect and damage the tissues, and after a few minutes are ineffective. If we ask the physician how exactly and how long the treatment will continue, he will not know because it is - in the absence of an appropriate tool - not a wellpublished scientific area. THE SOLUTION Our solution can maintain the set temperature in the range of 25 to 45 degrees Celsius, for hours. The type of disease, its location and the characteristics of the patient can all influence the proper therapy. These features are partially recorded by the patient to the smartphone application, or measured by the device. Collecting the scores of the symptoms from the patient (subjective score) or from the doctor (objective score) the analysis can evaluate the optimal treatment.

It is wearable (WiFi connection, batteries) and there are multiple peripheral unitsts for different body parts. The central part is common, it is connected to the peripheral part by a cable and a plug. The GUI is highly customizable, depending on the gender, the age and the nationality of the user. The next step is to check the specifications for used materials and operating parameters. WHAT MAKES OUR SOLUTION INNOVATIVE Currently, the device has no alternative. Based on the patent, this can be the first therapeutic tool to develop itself by collecting and analyzing data. The control panel is a smartphone app, so it can be always up-to-date and it can advertise personalized supply (e.g. clinics, pharmaceuticals, shops) even in an anonimous environment. There are no sensitive data (like email, phone Nr or name) stored about the patients. The device GUI is password protected. DESCRIPTION OF USP The innovation has been presented In the Shanghai TV's ""Junior Edison"" competition. This, according to the creators of the show, means 12 million views. This is a great opportunity to introduce the product and to find a manufacturing partner in China (we do not exclude this option). In the first period we plan to sell the basic equipment as a wellness device. Then we can develop a centrallycontrolled, strilizable device for hospital use. THE IP SITUATION The patent (P1700449) is actually approved as a national (Hungarian) patent but it protects the invention for the first year. On this summer we plan to extend the protection to the international level. The only author of this patent is Melinda Szegedi but it was submitted to this startup company as contribution. HOW WE WILL EARN MONEY There is a wide demand for the device. Calculating the appropriate patient groups, the frequency of thermo-therapy and the financial resources of each country, we can state that we have millions of potential buyers. The results of innovation competitions in Hungary, China (and hopefully in America, thanks to the ongoing Intel ISEF competition), provide a great media coverage. Over 10 million people who hear about the invention without any paid marketing activity. IDENTIFIED COMPETITORS We have mapped similar patents and competitors during the patent literature research. The products closest to the present invention are: Wristify, Heated Jacket, Refrigerated Helmets, and pre-hair refinishing caps for chemotherapy. We want to prove our theory about the physiological mechanism of thermo-therapy (called ""immunocyte thermotaxis"") which explains the effectiveness of low energy contact heat conduction therapy.","Health Care, Internet Services",4,1-10,"Dóra Szegedi, Melinda Szegedi, Viktor Sebestyén Varga, Zsolt Szegedi",1,Seed,2018-04-27,37000,USD,37000,Pre-Seed,37000,USD,37000,Pre-Seed,37000,USD,37000,37000,USD,37000,Hiventures,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,8

Our software empowers your audience to be able to interact with your presentation in real-time through their smart devices. SOPRESO is an audience response system that works as an additional communication layer to any presentation format. Our web-based software enables the audience to raise questions, add comments to individual slides and even rate the entire presentation.  SOPRESO has three focuses:  1. Simplicity. Current presentation interaction software can have a tedious set up. Audiences have to either download an app or create an account or navigate to the presentation and by the time they have your presentation pulled up, you’ve completely lost the audiences attention. SOPRESO has a 1-Step Setup that simply requires your audience to enter a shortened URL in their mobile browser. No apps. No Accounts. Just you and your presentation. Unlike other presentation hosting software, SOPRESO simply mirrors your presentation, meaning that any presentation format will work with our software. This also means that any network malfunction will not effect your presentation or result in loss of data. 2. Interactivity. The core purpose of SOPRESO is to engage your audience. This is facilitated through a few key features in our software: Instant Slide Access - Audience members can follow the presenter’s slides on their mobile during the presentation, allowing attendees in the back of the room easy access to the same information as those closer to the screen. If the presenter is moving too quickly, audience members can go to previous slides or skip ahead to what’s coming up. This also can vastly improve the experience for virtual participants.  Real-time commenting – audience members can add comments and vote on those that they identify with. This brings the best comments and questions to the top. Digital Business Cards – Audience members can easily garner contact information from the presenter and their fellow attendees. No more wasting time gathering business cards and entering them into your address book. 3. Uniqueness. As a cost effective, easy-to-use service, we believe that SOPRESO would make any presenter stand out from the crowd.","Data and Analytics, Other, Software",3,1-10,"Dénes Pál, Lorinc Alvégi, Máté Wohlmuth",2,Seed,2014-10-01,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,"Day One Capital, EIT Digital Accelerator, Axel Springer Plug and Play Accelerator",1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
