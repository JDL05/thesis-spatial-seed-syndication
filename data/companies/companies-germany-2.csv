Founding and early history Enpal was founded in 2017 by Mario Kohle, Jochen Ziervogel, and Viktor Wingert. The company received early backing from Lukasz Gadowski, the prominent entrepreneur and venture capitalist, and several board members of the Zalando fashion conglomerate. Enpal’s co-founders initially developed a sales-based business model, where end-users could purchase PV systems. Early market research suggested that a lease model would attract more uptake from customers who didn’t want the hassle of high investment costs and maintaining the solar system by themselves.  The company settled on a 20-year lease term, which proved wildly successful during the first few years of its existence. Its lease agreements require no upfront payment from the customer and include installation, insurance, maintenance and other services. Rapid growth and expansion For most of its history, Enpal focused on the German market, first around its hometown of Berlin and later throughout the whole country. During the late 2010s and early 2020s, the company opened several satellite offices in an effort to provide responsive, localized sales and service to customers across the country. In 2021, Enpal opened a state-of-the-art training center for solar PV installers, where it trains its rapidly growing team of craftsmen. The company now has more than 200 local installer teams, whose members make up the bulk of Enpal’s employee roster, and a robust, efficient supply chain. Enpal’s key backers have included major impact investors and climate-tech venture firms, including Princeville Climate Technologies, Softbank Vision Fund II, TPG Rise Climate, HV Capital, The Westly Group, and Activate Capital. Co-founder Mario Kohle remains a managing director of the company. Fellow co-founders Jochen Ziervogel and Viktor Wingert (the current Chief Investment Officer) remain deeply involved as well.  Enpal has won a number of awards over the years, including first place in the German Sustainability Prize Next Economy Award 2022, first place in the 2023 Smart Home Germany Awards, a 2023/2024 Stern Companies of the Future award, Die Welt #1 Service Champion in Customer Service Award, and KfW Award for Entrepreneurs 2022. The Enpal app was also awarded as Germany’s best solar management app. The company has also been among Germany’s fastest-growing companies in 2022 and 2023 based on the FT1000 ranking. Enpal today Today, Enpal has installed more than 60,000 solar PV systems across Germany and Italy. As of late 2022, Enpal is recognized as the market leader for solar PV installations in Germany. The company’s 2022 revenues exceeded 400 million euros on a headcount of more than 1,000 employees. After pivoting away from the sales model and focusing on leased systems for most of its history, Enpal added back a sales option in 2023 to accommodate customers who want to buy their solar solution. Either model can save the customer tens of thousands of euros over the course of a system’s 20- to 25-year useful lifespan, according to company data. Enpal has also diversified its product offerings in recent years. It now offers all-in-one renewable energy solutions consisting of solar panels, battery, wallbox, heat pump and energy management system.","Energy, Natural Resources, Professional Services, Sustainability",3,1001-5000,"Jochen Ziervogel, Mario Kohle, Viktor Wingert",17,,2025-04-07,110000000,EUR,120799075,Venture - Series Unknown,110000000,EUR,120799075,Venture - Series Unknown,575000000,EUR,643965092,3485000000,EUR,3817606297,"TPG, European Investment Bank, BlackRock, Bank of America, HV Capital",14,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Product life cycle management involves making design decisions based on multiple criteria including cost, compliance, sustainability, and risk. Unfortunately, the data and expertise required to make these decisions are siloed. This protracts the process of innovation and increases its complexity.  Today, the market solves this problem with vertical applications like PDM, ERP, CAD, EHS, SCM, etc. These mostly remain siloed due to the enormous costs of integration and keeping data synchronized. Therefore, analyses typically require exporting data to aggregation tools e.g. BI or excel before being used for analyses in specialist decision support applications. Results are typically delayed, some taking as much as 9 months, and therefore provide little support during the design process. Makersite provides results instantly and simultaneously across key product criteria. Makersite combines external and internal data sources to create a digital twin of a product in design. Artificial intelligence and its graph-based data model allow for ingesting, representing, and connecting heterogeneous data easily. Its native applications use algorithms to support analysis and decision-making based on multiple criteria simultaneously including should-costs, regulatory compliance, life cycle impacts (LCA), supply chain risk, etc. The API-first architecture allows for easy integrations into existing IT infrastructures thereby supporting systems and processes with richer, fresher, and more timely product data. This allows engineers to understand and improve their designs from the perspective of their regulatory compliance, environmental impact, supply risk, and cost of production, simultaneously. Companies can get results up to 40x faster than traditional methods while making their products better.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Other, Professional Services, Software, Transportation",1,51-100,Neil Dsouza,5,Early Stage Venture,2022-10-18,18200000,EUR,17950028,Series A,18200000,EUR,17950028,Series A,18200000,EUR,17950028,18271429,EUR,18031896,"Hitachi Ventures, Translink Capital, Planet A Ventures, KOMPAS VC, EASME",4,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The company is based in Dresden, Germany.FMC commercializes a disruptive material innovation that will solve this problem for current and future technology nodes, i.e. eNVM based on ferroelectric hafnium oxide (FE-HfO2). The unexpected physical effect of ferroelectricity in HfO2 allows for the transformation of classical high-k metal-gate (HKMG) transistors into nonvolatile ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFET). In this way, MCUs can easily be scaled from e.g. 65 nm down to 28 nm and beyond enabling tremendous advantages for the overall system: SoC cost reduction of around 80%, per bit write energy reduction by a factor of 1000 and an overall performance gain of the system of around 70% due to the transition to advanced process nodes.

This revolutionary approach was proven to be successful with the launching of the automated yeast cell counters & apps for breweries and wineries: •	Oculyze BB 2.0 (Better Brewing) Yeast Cell Counter App •	Oculyze FW (Fermentation Wine) Yeast Cell Counter App The Oculyze yeast cell counting kit works by using a microscope connected to a smartphone or tablet and the Oculyze app. The images are then uploaded to the cloud where they are analyzed by image recognition algorithms, offering quantitative real-time image analysis.  Breweries and wineries of all sizes around the world have now chosen to replace the time-consuming and human error - prone standard method (yeast cell count using haemocytometer) with Oculyze, a far more reliable, fast, and cost-saving solution for monitoring fermentation during all the stages of the production process.  While working on constantly improving its flagship products, Oculyze also focuses on bringing the advantages of cloud-based image recognition, like faster development time, lower cost and better image recognition to other applications such as ethanol and bioethanol (or ethanol fuel) production, blood or sperm counts, parasite detection in feces, asbestos fiber detection, emulsion analysis, and bacteria detection, thereby continuing to add applications to its cloud-based image recognition platform.   Oculyze can offer turnkey solutions to businesses, integrating three essential components – the image analysis platform (for data storage & backup, user authentication, and task handling), a custom image analysis & recognition software and the image capture software developed by Oculyze.

This includes advanced performance analysis of single vehicles, transparent efficiency comparison between vehicles and recommendations tools with actionable insights to increase efficiency of their fleets and help them make better decisions , all in a single-view dashboard. This significantly improves the customers’ bottom line and strengthens their competitive advantage in the market.

The further development of the original combustion engine through KEYOU to use hydrogen as a sustainable fuel constitutes a quantum leap in automotive technology. The interplay of efficiency and power density reaches a completely new level – at the end of which the only exhaust emission is harmless water vapor.","Sustainability, Transportation",2,51-100,"Alvaro Sousa, Thomas Korn",2,Seed,2020-03-18,,,,Pre-Seed,,,,Pre-Seed,,,,1533878,EUR,1704606,European Innovation Council,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

What makes trackle relevant right now?  With increasing age, the likelihood of getting pregnant lowers rapidly. Women who want to have kids lately need to know exactly about their fertility window in order to increase chances of getting pregnant.   Same applies for women who want to avoid pregnancy without hormone treatments. For them, it is important to know when their ovulation happens in order to choose the right means for contraception.  Knowing the individual fertility window becomes more and more relevant to a growing group of women.  What is the problem trackle is solving?  Identifying that rise of the body core temperature is challenging – especially as you need to avoid all noise that influences body core temperature. That is why women measure core temperature first thing in the morning before having moved. Thus, they operate with approximate values they enter into old fashioned scale paper graphs. How does trackle work? The wearable sensor is worn vaginal overnight and determines the core temperature every hour. It regularly transmits the values via a wireless connection to a gateway, which passes it on to a server. On the server it is processed and provided for the user’s mobile app.  Thus, the one and only relevant value can be identified easily: it is the lowest value measured overnight.

Elevators are a pain point for their owners: The operation and maintenance costs of the elevator generate some of the highest costs per square feet in the property and elevator downtimes cause extreme user dissatisfaction, high administrative burden for property managers and can even lead to justified rent reductions. Implementing operational obligations, such as maintenance, documentation and repair, lies in the primary responsibility of the property owners. However, due to high cost and often lack of expertise, this happens usually not only inefficiently, but also involves legal risks, for example due to failure to employ maintenance measures. In addition, there is a high information asymmetry between owner / property manager and elevator maintenance company, which often leads to disproportionately high maintenance costs. Simplifa structures, optimizes, and manages elevator portfolios for its customers. The startup serves as a central point of contact for owners and elevator service companies and acts as an expert on an equal footing in negotiations. Each elevator undergoes a technical inspection and is recorded in 360° shots to simulate a virtual “elevator twin”. In the event of system malfunctions, the maintenance company can ensure a much faster and more targeted repair thanks to the ""elevator twin"" without prior dispatch of a technician. Thanks to Simplifa, the operating and maintenance costs of the elevators are regularly reduced by about 30% while maintaining the same quality. In the future, the transmission of sensor data will provide a manufacturer-independent real-time analysis for a predictive maintenance system, which will reduce the manual test frequency of the elevators and avoid costly downtimes in advance.",Real Estate,2,51-100,"Hubertus von Schierstaedt, Ludwig Busse",1,Seed,2018-09-07,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,"PT1, BitStone Capital, Marc Stilke, Lars Grosenick",2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal is to offer convenience, save time and eliminate stress of pet owners by bringing pet healthcare to their doorstep. It is an easy appointment booking platform for pet owners to book verified mobile vets who will visit your home.  Why are we so passionate about this ? We understand how terrifying it can be for your pets to visit a Veterinary. Plus there are always these fear of whether the Vet is competent enough, whether the people at the clinic are friendly enough, whether the problem your pet is facing can be easily diagnosed, whether you will have to hop around and visit different Vets for the same problem you are facing. Then there is the question of time. No-one likes to travel all the way to the vet clinic and then wait for hours to finally get the Vet’s attention. With HUG A PET, you book fixed appointment, the consultation is as long as your pet needs it in the comfort of your home or office and your pet gets a personalized attention. We are disrupting the current pet healthcare quality and bringing comfort, personalized experience and superior quality to the pet owners.    Our Mission: Our mission for HUG A PET is simple : to attract, nurture and grow the world's best mobile health care providers for pets via our platform and compliment that with exceptional customer service. We are working hard to create a technology where we can support the Veterinarians to reach the pet owners faster, provide them with updated pet's medical and psychological history on their mobile device, and act as an operational ninja that constantly collaborates with latest status between the pet owner and the vet on-the-go. Our goal is to leapfrog and create substantial pet health care improvements, one customer at a time.

InkTech is a combination of inks and production technologies for Printed Electronics. Apart from selling inks, Saralon provides complete production know-hows for ready-to-use applications. These process know-hows are explained below. Printing process In traditional color printing, multiple color layers are printed with almost similar thicknesses. But in Printed Electronics, different layers are printed with different thicknesses, ranging from few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. Saralon has solved and simplified all these issues to transfer the know-hows to printing companies through an onsite training. Integration process In order to create an application based on Printed Electronics, the integration of graphics printed objects with electronics must be done in a cost-effective way. Saralon, with its long expertise in the field of integration techniques, provides full support to printing companies to develop ready-to-use applications. Sustainable Electronics Electronics produced by printing machines and by using Saralon’s InkTech are sustainable.","Administrative Services, Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Internet Services, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",2,1-10,"Dr. Moazzam Ali, Steve Paschky",1,Seed,2016-03-02,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,TGFS - Technologiegründerfonds Sachsen,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
