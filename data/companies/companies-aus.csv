Existing claims processes suffer from significant friction in the user journey and a lack of cost control for insurers.  We eliminate the friction in this process while putting effective cost controls in place. Our solution is to provide insurers with co-branded debit cards distributed to their members. Each member can use their card at any health-related facility in the world - eliminating out-of-pocket expenses entirely. Think of corporate spend management providers like Payhawk, only for international and domestic private health insurers.  So, the advantages are obvious: we help insurers to provide a 10x better user experience and to achieve substantial cost savings by providing structured data, offering real-time visibility on claims costs, minimizing fraudulent claims, and implementing a reward/cashback program to steer user behavior.","Financial Services, Health Care, Information Technology, Payments",2,11-50,"Fredrik Debong, Sebastian Gruber",4,M&A,2023-01-11,6000000,EUR,6459371,Seed,6000000,EUR,6459371,Seed,10000000,EUR,10916958,10000000,EUR,10916958,"Speedinvest, Fin Capital, Seedcamp, Nina Capital, Calm/Storm Ventures",3,9,,Was Acquired,hi.health acquired by Pliant,https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/pliant-275b-acquires-hi-health--f866ff1f,Pliant,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pliant-275b,2025-04-16,day,,,,Acquisition,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Regular trading makes it difficult to keep track of the individual trades. This is mainly because every single transaction, including the exchange within crypto currencies, must be valued as a taxable event. If the tax office requests a declaration or proof, it will be difficult to provide this afterwards.   This is where Blockpit's software solution can help. The monitoring platform automatically records all sources of income and creates a clear log. Every single transaction is imported and guarantees a daily documentation of all trades.
