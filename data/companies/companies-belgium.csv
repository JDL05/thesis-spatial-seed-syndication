Our unwavering commitment is to prioritize the safety of all parties engaged in this endeavor. Our ultimate aim is to seamlessly incorporate drones into the global airspace, ensuring their seamless integration into our daily routines. This fundamental aspiration is the driving force behind the establishment of Unifly. Two air traffic controllers harbored a common vision: they observed an increasing presence of drones in the airspace, yet they lacked the means to effectively manage or visualize these unmanned aircraft. The questions arose: How can you spot the drone, and where is its operator? How do you establish a connection with them? This vision led to the birth of Unifly, a collective of aerospace experts who embarked on a mission to create a platform facilitating the secure integration of drones into the airspace. Initially born as a spin-off from VITO, the Flemish institute for technological research, Unifly has since blossomed into the industry's leading innovator in unmanned traffic management technology, earning multiple awards along the way. - Safety is paramount - Research indicates that the drone industry holds the potential for a market valuation of $130 billion. Drones possess the capacity to revolutionize our everyday experiences, yet there exists a critical caveat. Safety stands as an utmost priority and, consequently, emerges as our most pressing concern. Both national aviation authorities and private enterprises confront a paramount inquiry: ""How can we guarantee the vigilant oversight of both recreational and commercial drone activities to ensure security?"" - Innovation is key - Presently, we find ourselves presented with an extraordinary prospect to influence the airspace of the future. We hold a firm conviction that cooperation and transparency stand as indispensable elements in realizing this vision. This is precisely why Unifly engages in partnerships with numerous research entities and businesses, both within Belgium and on the global stage. Unifly's groundbreaking technology empowers governing bodies, corporations, and vital infrastructure operators to oversee the seamless integration of drones. Our open platform harmonizes the interests of all stakeholders, establishing an air traffic management system for drones that enhances visibility and averts potential collisions.","Apps, Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods, Hardware, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Real Estate, Science and Engineering, Software",4,51-100,"Andres Van Swalm, Hans Schrauwen, Jürgen Verstaen, Koen Meuleman",4,M&A,2022-05-03,10000000,EUR,10525441,Series B,10000000,EUR,10525441,Series B,33200000,EUR,36376442,33200000,EUR,36376442,"Terra Drone, Qbic Fund, PMV, SFPI-FPIM, DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung",3,6,1,"Made Acquisitions, Was Acquired",Unifly acquired by Terra Drone,https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/terra-drone-acquires-unifly--a29aac42,Terra Drone,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/terra-drone,2023-08-22,day,,,,Acquisition,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,4

No wonder it’s the biggest alcoholic beverage in business. Still, at Bar.on, we believe a few things could be better…  We’re ready to reshape the beer industry with personalised & planet-friendly beer!  As global warming and environmental degradation are changing the world faster than ever before, it’s time to do things differently. Beer is basically 90% branded water; the same thing that runs freely from our tap. What if there were a way to make any beer we like (including tasty alcohol-free beer) on the spot with tap water? This way, we could significantly reduce the shipping of beer, the related carbon footprint and the need for packaging. Sci fi? It’s called molecular mixing!  Together with the Verstrepen lab at VIB-KU Leuven, we’re bringing molecular beer mixing to the B2B and B2C markets in the next few years. The Verstrepen lab has been researching Belgian beer, its fermentation process and aroma compounds for over a decade. Thanks to their scientific expertise, we’ve found out how to capture the natural flavour and aroma compounds of beer and combine them into small cartridges. These compounds, mixed with tap water, allow you to recreate any beer at molecular level.  With our highly-innovative beer machines, cartridge system and fool-proof recipes, you will mix any beer you like by simply pushing a few buttons. How about tweaking the flavour of your favourite beer exactly to your taste? A triple, but not too strong? No problem. A bit more bitterness? You got it! High, low or even no alcohol? Coming up! Cheers to saving the world over a cold one!  Want to be the first one to know when we launch? Feel free to leave your e-mail address on our website.

It’s in our oceans, and on our beaches, and it’s causing harm. We are consuming plastic at staggering rates, since it’s durable and cheap to produce. As we know, plastic is strong, flexible and durable making it extremely useful, however, that also means it never really breaks down.   A plastic bottle can last for 450 years in the marine environment, slowly fragmenting into smaller and smaller pieces which eventually end up microscopic but never truly go away. This means that every piece of plastic that has ever been produced is still with us, in some form. Current estimates show that at last 8 million pieces of plastic are entering the oceans every single day, with all the implications that entails. So, it’s our belief that we need to take better care of our planet. Luckily, a lot of people acknowledge these dangers and many beautiful initiatives have launched in the past years to save our precious planet earth.

Central to Logion's mission is the empowerment of tokens across various blockchains, elevating them to legal-grade digital assets with real-world relevance. In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, a significant gap exists between the on-chain representation of assets (tokens on the blockchain) and their real-world rights and values. Logion addresses this challenge by synergizing advanced blockchain technology with a comprehensive legal framework. This innovative approach ensures that tokens extend beyond mere digital representations, embodying verifiable rights, obligations, and tangible value. At the heart of Logion's infrastructure is the ""Proof of Law"" concept, a unique and pivotal feature that assures the legal enforceability and legitimacy of every token and digital asset on the platform. It signifies a token's tangible value and the rights attached to it, effectively bridging the gap between digital and physical realms. Beyond token-based operations, Logion's versatility shines in its application to non-token processes, particularly in enhancing the security and efficiency of supply chains. By implementing Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology, Logion certifies data without compromising privacy, under the oversight of a decentralized network of Judicial Officers. This approach guarantees not only technical safety but legal protection, fostering a digital economy that is transparent, trustworthy, and accessible to a broader audience. Logion is more than a blockchain platform; it's a visionary initiative to transform how digital assets are viewed and utilized, bringing unparalleled transparency and legal integrity to the forefront of the digital age.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other",2,11-50,"David Schmitz, Elie Auvray",1,Seed,2022-05-25,100000,USD,100000,Pre-Seed,100000,USD,100000,Pre-Seed,100000,USD,100000,100000,USD,100000,"Outlier Ventures, Primal Capital, WING by Digital Wallonia",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Our solution gives users the opportunity to trigger a photo device placed up to 250 meters from them! The final result is a panoramic selfie: a short video that zooms out from the original location to end on a beautiful panorama. This gives attractions the chance to show off their entire area, rather than just the background of a selfie – potentially generating social recommendation and increasing brand recognition on social media. The videos produced are trackable, so attractions can see how often a video is viewed or reward the best ambassadors.  Clearly, our ambition is to empower user content with additional value, specifically adapted for the leisure and tourism industries.   We’re currently working hard to install our first permanent solutions by summer 2017. We can't wait to see them in cities, museums, theme parks, sport venues, cruise companies, hotels & resorts.
