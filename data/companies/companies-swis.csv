STALICLA’s unique approach addresses a principal weakness in the drug development process for NDD’s and neuropsychiatric disorders: behavior is a terrible biomarker. Clinical psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnoses encompass a broad diversity of underlying biology. This has contributed to drug development failure by diluting true responders in a population of patients with heterogeneous biology. STALICLA’s technology platform, DEPI, discovers biologically based endophenotypes within classical neuropsychiatric diagnostic groups. The AI/ML engine converges molecular data with human genetic information and non-behavioral clinical signs and symptoms, to define biologically related subgroups and create testable clinical hypotheses related to that biology. The DEPI platform has already completed several successful clinical validations, through the identification and biological validation of two distinct subgroups of patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD-Phenotype1 and ASD-Phenotype2, together with their predicted tailored treatment candidates (STP1 and STP2); as well as the blindly and retrospective calling “high” responder patients to previously failed drug candidates with high specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value.

The company raised a EUR 5.1m Seed round in March 2022 and won two awards in Cybersecurity since its inception, including the 2022 best startup award from the International Forum on Cybersecurity (FIC). The company is active in the European, Asian and US markets and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, with operations in Serbia and US California. Its largest clients include Broadcom in San Jose California and WeBank in China.  The company is active in the EU, Asian, and US markets and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland has over 25 employees, 8 nationalities and a satellite office in Belgrade, Serbia. The founders have established a culture of performance and “lean” from its inspection and attracted a team of very diverse similarly minded technical and business professionals. Our customers have a dual problem:(1) improve the efficiency of their development process along the DevOps cycle and (2) deal with security requirements against data leaks. These two problems are usually solved separately. Improved alignment is achieved with solutions to manage containers for development. Security against data leaks is achieved with infrastructure such as VDI or DaaS. Strong Network's platform achieves these goals jointly, with superior benefits, but most importantly with security that doesn't get in the way of developers' productivity. In contrast to DaaS streaming desktops, our platform delivers a low-bandwidth, locally executing development environment with frontend and backend security resulting in higher ROI and productivity, and improved security posture.

This value chain includes: (1) innovative biosensor development, (2) custom hardware design; (3) data collection and analysis; and (4) product integration. IDUN Technologies integrates neuroscience into every-day product designs, enabling connected devices to understand the emotional needs of people, providing for happier and more fulfilling product experiences. IDUN achieves this by delivering the full neurofeedback value chain from electrode manufacturing to product design integration. This allows the brain waves of an individual to be comfortably characterized through-out the day to understand their unique emotional needs. Through the IDUN API, actional inputs are sent to connected devices, providing more interactive and fulfilling product experiences. Our goal is to fuse emotion intelligence with connected devices, enabling cohesion and understanding between humans and the connected world. Electroencephalography (EEG) imaging of the brain allows us to characterize the way in which our brain processes information. From EEG signals we extract features related to the emotional and cognitive loads of people. While EEG recording has been used in controlled laboratory environments for decades, it has not been integrated into consumer devices that seamlessly integrate with daily life. We believe that daily measurements of the brain will unlock insights that are not possible with only laboratory measurements. Each brain is unique, with its own algorithm that we are focused on decoding.

To produce knowledge based on data Archilyse uses four generic power-simulations, such as view, geometrical, connectivity and physical analysis, from which countless others can be derived. Their results provide the most comprehensive view on architecture currently available worldwide.  This is how it works: 2D floor plans in the form of PDFs or building image files are converted to 3D BIM-Light models and geo-referenced. Using API (Application Program Interface) calls, professional users can analyse building models drawn from algorithms which translated the latest scientific findings into formulas. The results are presented to users in easy-to-read heatmaps or can be exported in the form of key figure tables for further processing. This process renders portfolio digitalisation profitable for the first time.

JANZZ.technology was originally founded in Zurich in 2008. It is a genuine Swiss company that since the start has been operated by serious investors and experienced personalities from the fields of information and communications technology, human resources, jurisprudence, marketing and business development. The goals of JANZZ.technology are clear: in addition to viable and sustainable business development, the company is strongly focused on ensuring that its products and solutions offer real economic and social benefit. Everyone should be able to benefit from JANZZ.technology, not only in Switzerland, but worldwide. JANZZ.technology launched its first product at the end of 2010: JANZZ.jobs, an innovative employment matching platform designed to reinvigorate labor and job markets, considerably improve on the systems previously used in portals of this kind, and optimize the operations of public employment services. Since 2013 three more, powerful SaaS B2B and B2G solutions were launched – JANZZon!, JANZZclassifier! and JANZZsme! – together with the simple, secure JANZZjobsAPI interface. These solutions, which are superior to conventional full-text-based technologies and applications, have been used in a variety of combinations and applications for structuring and efficiently and intelligently using the large volumes of data available today relating to professional qualifications and hard and soft skills (known as occupation data), as they increase rapidly in complexity. With its cutting-edge solutions, JANZZ.technology is taking a bold step to advance the new area of cognitive computing in the field of occupations and skills. The era of cognitive computing is characterized by a fundamental shift in how machines interact with us, other machines and the environment. The ontology JANZZon! and the smart matching engine JANZZsme! make complex problems such as job and skills matching computable and completely change the way they think and go about job searching. As the applications of JANZZ.technology are structured semantically, that is, occupations, skills and many more concepts are interlinked logically, they can deliver meaningful results for complex searches for job vacancies, employees, freelancers etc. Importantly, these applications constantly learn and therefore become more accurate over time. According to Gartner, the era of cognitive computing, also called the smart machine era will be the most disruptive in the history of IT.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Government and Military, Internet Services, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",1,11-50,Stefan Winzenried,9,Seed,2021-01-01,4127000,CHF,4636688,Seed,4127000,CHF,4636688,Seed,15680853,USD,15680853,15680853,USD,15680853,"Kwe.li, Advertising, Art & Ideas, Oprandi & Partner, Roberto Oprandi, Publigroupe S.A.",,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

This is why we focus on this target group for the next 2-3 years before we open up to the more general market as soon as it makes sense.

To battle with these things every day is extremely stressful and discouraging.  Here we can help. We have developed a digital productivity assistant that 1) guides users through their day by assisting them in estimating the duration of tasks, planning their day, prioritizing, etc., 2) actively interacts with its users to build up a personal relationship, and 3) gets to know its users (routines, most productive time, optimal structure of day, etc.) to become a better assistant every day.

We sell our product to OEMs, National Sales companies and large dealership groups.  There are three main reasons why automotive companies choose Remoto: 1)	We help them to increase customer retention by creating engaging content and functions for the end-users that keeps their attention on smartphone application and effectively promotes their products and services. 2)	We use Artificial Intelligence to predict customer behaviour in order to find the right moment to upsell to them. That helps OEMs to bring customers back to their dealerships and to increase their revenue. 3)	We develop all the apps, cloud back-end, hardware and machine learning algorithms by ourselves, which is why we can make the project live in 4 months after the contract has been signed. That’s an unbeatable timeframe in the current market.
