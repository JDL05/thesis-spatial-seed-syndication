Augmenta’s “Field Analyzer”, is a plug and play device that can be attached to any tractor and can determine the amount of fertilizers, fungicides and pesticides that every inch of the farm needs to reach to its full potential, all in real-time. Furthermore, Field Analyzer is capable of controlling agricultural machinery (e.g. fertilizer spreaders) also in real-time, applying the optimal amount of chemicals into every inch of the farm completely automatically and without the farmer lifting a finger. Finally, the farmer can use Augmenta’s field-viewer, the company’s easy to use web platform, to observe the progression of his field through visual data analytics which help him keep track of the results of Augmenta’s real time operation but also assist him on making data-driven, customized decisions for the future, in a farm level scale and not in a generic geographical (county or even state/country) level scale which is the norm today.
