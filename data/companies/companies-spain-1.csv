Currently, cancer incidence in the world exceeds 14 million cases per year and results in 8 million deaths annually. Moreover, such numbers are forecast to rise by 75% over the next 20 years (World Cancer Report. International Agency for Research on Cancer 2014). At the moment, standard therapies include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and, in a restricted subset of cancers, precision medicine. Unfortunately, very often these therapies fail, due to the development of resistance. Peptomyc has adopted a different strategy based on the inhibition of the oncoprotein Myc, which is found deregulated in the majority of human cancers. Myc holds a non-redundant function in cancer around which tumors cannot evolve, hence targeting Myc is the most promising therapeutic opportunity to date.

OnTruck puts companies in contact with a wide network of professional carriers, in order to provide a reliable and efficient delivery service, and with the possibility to check in real time the status of each shipment. For their part, carriers can receive orders and accept them if they wish through a free application, so that they can complete the loading of their vehicles and increase their income. For the creation and implementation of OnTruck, its founders allocated 100,000 euros, although friends and family soon wanted to participate, with an investment of 500,000 euros. In October 2016, they closed a first round of financing worth 2 million euros, in which Point Nine Capital, based in Berlin, participated; the British fund Local Globe; and Samaipata Ventures. In May 2017, a second round of financing of 9.2 million euros led by Atomico took place, followed by the French fund IdInvest, and the venture capital arm of the company, also French, Total Energy. In May 2018 they received their third round of financing worth 25 million euros, led by the Cathay Innovation fund, followed by Atomico, Idinvest Partners, All Iron Ventures, Total Energy Ventures, GP Bullhound. The startup, which is focused on the regional palletized merchandise transport service, currently operates in two countries: Spain and the United Kingdom. In Spain it is present in the downtown area (Madrid and neighboring provinces), Catalonia and the Valencian Community. In the United Kingdom it operates in London and in the Southeast area of ​​the country.  Yours is a simple, transparent and effective service. On the one hand, it provides an immediate way to access their prices, simply by entering the web and quoting shipping. Any company can schedule a shipment for free and hire in less than two minutes a load of any dry or refrigerated merchandise on local or regional routes in the areas it currently operates. The transport can be for that same time or scheduled, that is, the typical services of 24h and 48h, which means that they can pick up any palletized goods in less than 30 minutes. They are also very competitive in price within their sector, becoming up to 50% cheaper compared to the rates that are usually handled in the sector. On the other hand, OnTruck are firmly committed to optimizing the use of industrial vehicles by generating routes. Its technological solution seeks to capture the inefficiencies that are generated in the regional transport of goods when you combine and execute a high volume of loads in a very defined geographical area and generate opportunities for routes that reduce the number of kilometers that vehicles in our network make in empty.","Administrative Services, Transportation",6,51-100,"Antonio Lu, Gonzalo Parejo Navajas, Inigo Juantegui, Javier Fernandez Escribano, Rika Christanto, Samuel Fuentes",7,Early Stage Venture,2021-04-08,,,,Grant,17000000,EUR,19189676,Series B,60533977,USD,60533977,60533977,USD,60533977,"LocalGlobe, Endeavor Catalyst, Acurio Ventures, Bossa Invest, Cathay Innovation",5,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their best efforts, their WordPress sites on mobile devices were slow and sluggish. We got down to work and developed a mobile WordPress theme for them, called Frontity PRO. Our goal: to make it as performant as possible while delivering a remarkable user experience. To achieve that, we built an internal React framework which used the REST API to fetch the content of their WordPress sites, and spent the whole year optimizing it. We faced a lot of challenges and realized that combining WordPress and React wasn’t easy. But at the end, the theme was a success: it was used by more than 20 million readers and proven ideal for building engaging and modern frontend experiences. In 2019 we decided to use all that knowledge and lessons learnt to launch an open source framework, so anyone who wants to use WordPress as a headless CMS with a React frontend could benefit.

Low average motorcycle price: also if the motorcycle is in perfect conditions 3.	Low or null value of motorcycles accessories and modifications  Motoblockchain offers a Motorcycle Digital Identity based on privacy by design and DLT technologies: it collects the documentation about the history of the motorcycles and it uses Blockchain to make it tamper proof, while giving to the user full control over it in a full GDPR compliant system. Owners can save all the information related with motorcycle’s life in our platform that is constantly connected with the Blockchain: owner’s history, mileage in time, invoices and money invested in modifications, accessories, improvements, revisions, as well as all the photos of the related components. We access motorcycle data with the MOBD (patented) IOT system equipped with OBD II connection and IOT sensors: it makes the motorcycle autonomously update data into the Digital Identity. The MOBD additionally provides several disruptive functionalities designed to improve user's safety and collected in one unified IOT tool. We use AI-on-chip to do predictive failure anytime the motorcycle is started, we provide remote failure detection so that mechanics can remotely diagnose failures and prevent accidents, we provide incident detection and emergency call (eCall) services), we use Big Data & AI to analyze the data recorded and to provide recommendations, singularities, trend calculations, behaviour patterns to assurance companies and motorcycle manufacturers (OEM). Every user can decide the level of privacy of each document, he can decide with whom to share it and finally he can use it to create trust with the buyer so generating added value during the sales process.

Nowadays, there is a growing number of scenarios -in- house domestic applications, traffic lights, hospitals, hotels, etc.- where illumination devices based on visible LED lamps are used. This interest is not only motivated by economic reasons (as the price of individual lamps is still higher than that of traditional ones, although it is rapidly becoming cheaper and cheaper) but by energetic or environmental considerations. These lamps combine very low power consumption with an extremely long operational life, maintaining during all their operation the same chromaticity without significant changes. LED lamps can be also used as communications emitters without losing their main functionality as illumination sources. This technique (known as Visible Light Communications or VLC) does not only maintain the usual capabilities of wireless optical transceivers (robustness against EM interference, absence of EM compatibility constraints and secure transmissions as radiation is confined by walls) but is also eye-safe (as it uses visible wavelengths). Additionally, as they are used as lamps, the amount of optical emitted power is enough to provide full transmission coverage over a regular size room.

As the first digital payment network - unlike incumbent legacy schemes - it does not issue cards. Instead of issuing cards, Dinube employs account-to-account payments based on the European SEPA Instant Credit Transfer Scheme, enabling realtime payment between customers' and retailers' bank accounts. The Dinube superapp syncs any European bank account to provide account information (AISP) services and payment initiation (PISP) to any retail merchant, in-store, online or offline. In February 2014, Dinube became the first network to perform a contactless payment on a pinpad terminal using a mobile device (HCE on Android and Ingenico POI). In May 2016 Dinube presented OPTO, a new, alternative contactless technology to radio-frequency NFC, enabling contactless any smartphone. OPTO is based on near-field light waves. The technology is now widely used in the vending industry in several European countries. In 2018, Dinube filed a new patent for privacy algorithms, making it the first payment network that emphasizes protecting users' privacy and avoiding the collection and tracking of personal data. Dinube distinguishes itself from other payment networks by not profiling its users and by eliminating cards and thereby the associated fees for retailers.","Financial Services, Payments, Privacy and Security",1,1-10,Jonathan Hayes,1,Seed,2014-10-10,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,Ona Capital Privat SCR SA,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
