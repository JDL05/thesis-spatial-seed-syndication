But 3D creation is still stuck in the past: slow, manual, fragmented, and fundamentally unscalable. That’s the crack in the foundation and Alpha3D is stepping straight through it. Our platform transforms simple inputs - text, images, rough assets into fully usable, customizable 3D scenes and models. Instantly. No templates. No gimmicks. Just a full generative engine that turns imagination into interactive content, ready for real-world use across gaming, XR, e-commerce, digital twins, and beyond. While others tinker with tools, we’re building infrastructure. While competitors rely on third-party datasets, we’ve built a proprietary, AI-native dataset with millions of structured assets and a roadmap to 100 million by 2026. Every object, every remix, every prompt becomes data that trains our models, sharpens our output, and tightens our feedback loop. That’s our moat and it grows with every click. We’ve already reached over 600K users without spending a cent on paid marketing. Enterprise partners are lining up for early API access. And our platform evolves daily through real-time creator feedback, telemetry, and Moonlander-powered model refinement. While others are building workflows, we’re building the AI brain of the 3D web. By the time most companies catch up, we’ll already be there - training the models, owning the data, and powering the platforms they’re trying to build on. This isn’t just a bet on 3D. It’s a bet on the future of the internet.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software",4,11-50,"Gholamreza Anbarjafari, Madis Alesmaa, Mariliis Retter, Rait-Eino Laarmann",5,Seed,2023-09-01,850000,EUR,916937,Convertible Note,723000,EUR,796868,Pre-Seed,803000,EUR,887075,1708000,EUR,1867960,"ZAKA VC, Curiosity VC",2,2,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,7

These forward contracts often underdeliver, and you can't do anything with this illiquid future promise for credits in 5+ years.  Solid World DAO accelerates carbon project development through fair, transparent and liquid markets.

The improved connection between producers and suppliers could reduce the problem annually by $60B. Lack of supply chain visibility causes food companies to lose annually $179M in the US alone. Companies can save up to $120B by decreasing supply chain inefficiency. Supply chains are disconnected due to multiple actors having different technical capacities and traditional systems having barriers such as centralized data control, customization complexity, and high implementation costs. Especially small companies can’t build and maintain those systems and are isolated from supply chain digitization. SOLUTION ------ How Smart Hub works:   https://www.obortech.io/solution How various actors collaborate together to build the product story at multiple levels of the supply chain:    https://youtu.be/r5_Fh_9LeY8?si=hpkp1NW9JV27B_zK The Smart Hub connects producers, transporters, and consumers via a single platform:    https://youtu.be/9x7LcvZdzzo?si=3s8_PSxy88ThQ0sR The Smart Hub is a highly customizable solution with fast deployment, requiring only 1-2 weeks to set up. It can streamline and digitize any manual data gathering from field users, factory experts, remote suppliers, transportation, and office workers through its web and mobile applications and open API tools. Collected data is registered on a tamper-proof blockchain platform accessible and verifiable by multiple actors. Users can act promptly and make agile decisions based on real-time notifications and events sent IoT sensors and the platform users. It can be a data collection tool to complement any in-house data management systems, feeding them multi-actor verified data from various supply chain environments. Using the Smart Hub, supply chain actors can share, comment, accept, monitor, and verify various events and documents in the supply chain to collaborate with other users digitally. The Smart Hub is a multi-actor collaboration platform that creates value for each participant. It does not just create traceability data for product batches with few events and inventory numbers. It can build a rich story of the product by different supply chain participants. The Smart Hub is designed to operate in a way similar to a social network (Facebook, etc). Multiple actors build together a story of a product in an environment similar to a “News feed.” Then, they create NFT on the public blockchain to share the story with public users like consumers. It can be a simple tool for enhancing any in-house traceability system.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other, Software, Transportation",1,11-50,Tamir Baasanjav,7,Seed,2023-10-02,200000,USD,200000,Grant,1000,USD,1000,Seed,3000,USD,3000,505779,USD,505779,"Microsoft, Google for Startups, Newchip Accelerator, AWS Impact Accelerator, Poland Prize Program",,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Restricted access to cutting edge research articles has severely affected new innovations and discoveries from these regions, slowing their development and sometimes even restricting access to basic knowledge that could push their realities further.","Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Design, Education, Media and Entertainment",2,1-10,"Nadeera Nilupamali, Neeraj Mehta",2,Seed,2013-09-23,15000,EUR,20250,Pre-Seed,15000,EUR,20250,Pre-Seed,60250,USD,60250,60250,USD,60250,"Startup Wise Guys, Start-Up Chile",,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The product is synthesized by the method of controlled liquid phase oxidation, which ensures a high production rate. The test facility has proven the efficacy of the production process for delivering volumes of high-quality aluminum oxide nano fibers in excess of 0.5 kilograms per hour in a continuous production cycle 24/7, 3 000 kg per year. The production process has been patented, allowing ANF Technology to develop sales channels and research partners without jeopardizing potential market share of the nano fiber market. The production process allows for increases in volume up to 100 times the current production levels, thus eliminating the main roadblock in the nano fiber industry (lack of industrial scale production capacity). NAFEN™ is the revolutionary nanomaterial of the next technological wave for which nanotubes have been preparing the world for over 20 years. Having this industrial technology at hand, numerous NAFEN™- inside solutions will be developed and implemented.  NAFEN™ provides a unique combination of properties including controllable diameter of 7 to 40 nm, length of over 150 millimeters, high tensile strength, vast surface area, chemical inertness, stability against radiation, and thermal stability. • fiber diameter is controllable by production parameters, from 7 to 40 nm • individual fiber length up to 150 mm supplied in co-aligned or random structure • bulk density 0.09–3.5 g/cm3 • supplied in dry form or dispersed in water or alcohols","Sales and Marketing, Science and Engineering",,11-50,,4,,2015-01-08,2491038,EUR,2937115,Venture - Series Unknown,2491038,EUR,2937115,Venture - Series Unknown,14759769,USD,14759769,14759769,USD,14759769,"EASME, First Imagine!, FPI Ventures",1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
