The system operates autonomously, burning waste without the need for additional energy sources or raw materials, ensuring a fully self-sustaining process. The heat generated is efficiently redirected to dry incoming wet waste, enabling continuous utilization. Designed specifically for small and medium-sized wastewater treatment plants, EMPYRIO’s on-site deployment eliminates the need for costly sewage sludge transportation, significantly reducing operational expenses. Traditional disposal methods often involve high gate fees, long-distance transport, and regulatory challenges, whereas EMPYRIO provides a far more cost-effective and compliant alternative. By utilizing the waste directly at its source, facilities avoid dependency on external processing plants and gain long-term financial predictability. In markets like Germany, where sludge disposal costs range from €280 to €480 per ton of dry solids, EMPYRIO’s system can reduce costs to just €150-230 per ton​, delivering multimillion-euro savings over a decade. EMPYRIO’s compact, modular design allows for seamless integration into existing wastewater treatment infrastructure without requiring costly facility modifications. Housed in standard 20- and 40-foot containers​, the system minimizes space requirements while ensuring easy scalability for various plant sizes. EMPYRIO’s technology is particularly effective for high-moisture and viscous organic waste, such as sewage sludge, chicken droppings, and other challenging materials that conventional technologies struggle to process. By providing an energy-efficient, space-saving, and cost-reducing solution, EMPYRIO supports sustainable waste management while ensuring compliance with stringent environmental regulations.","Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,1-10,Alexander Belskis,1,Seed,2022-05-12,650000,EUR,674628,Seed,650000,EUR,674628,Seed,650000,EUR,674628,650000,EUR,674628,"EIT InnoEnergy, Commercialization Reactor",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
