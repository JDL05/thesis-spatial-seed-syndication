You get to choose the recipes online and every week the selection is updated to make sure there’re plenty of new recipes for you. The recipes are delivered right to your doorstep once a week so you decide when to cook. Whenever you’re on holiday or just don’t have time, simply place the subscription on hold – it’s easy. Gousto was started in 2011 by two friends who share a passion for food and cooking. In their previous lives, Timo and James loved cooking but didn’t have much time to go to various grocery shops. They found it difficult to cook recipes from online databases or follow cook-along TV shows. Ready-meals from supermarkets do the job but the quality isn’t great, they have lots of additives, and they get boring very easily. One day, James and Timo decided that there must be some way to make life easier and the idea for Gousto was born. The first recipes were offered at market stalls and from there the concept has grown into what you see today. Of course, all of Timo and James' friends are Gousto guinea pigs.

The issues it can find often cannot cost-effectively be detected with the traditional use of sensors or lower resolution monitoring.

The communities are sponsored and moderated by leading patient organisations and nonprofits, such as the British Heart Foundation, Multiple Sclerosis Association of America and the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, to ensure the information shared on the platform is credible and safe.

It is positioned to become a leader in the provision of smart textiles for a diverse range of applications in a global market that is increasingly demanding intelligent fabrics. The company’s technology can be exclusively customised to meet the exact needs of its commercial partners in multiple healthcare areas and athletic and performance disciplines. This includes advanced wound care, compression garment systems, infant monitoring, athlete monitoring and remote monitoring of health and physiological symptoms for those in high risk environments, such as first responders and defence personnel. Footfalls & Heartbeats technology also has the potential to measure mechanical stress in composite structures to allow real time structural composite monitoring for satellites, aircraft wings, wind turbine blades, yacht hulls and foils and high performance car chassis. The technology currently measures tensile and compressive forces and temperature. Additional functionality being explored is the ability to track movement, bio-electrical outputs such as heart rate, active and passive skeletal muscle signals, as well as blood oxygen saturation, all of which will enable new applications. Footfalls & Heartbeats technology provides new opportunities for remote intervention to support individual monitoring with the potential to significantly reduce escalating healthcare costs for ageing populations and those with chronic illness and disease. Footfalls & Heartbeats technology can create uniquely durable, safe and comfortable fabrics that are comfortable and natural to wear, making them ideal for people with health conditions. Information from Footfalls & Heartbeats sensing textiles has the potential to deliver a wealth of data to improve health and other outcomes. The company is managed by Brent Ogilvie, who has extensive experience in early stage venture development, international business development and corporate partnering. This capability is supported by a group of high quality directors and active investors including Sparkbox Chairman Andrew Duff, entrepreneur Jeremy Collins, expat New Zealander David Bell who is Marketing Professor at Wharton Business School, and David Henry, its Chairman and former CFO of Fisher & Paykel.

The Kelda shower system holds appeal for a wide range of sectors, including gym and leisure, hotels and accommodation providers, healthcare, and maritime – all industries where water efficiency is key. The product has completed in-market validation and commercial trials, is in manufacture and the company has already signed installation deals with some of the largest leisure operators in the UK and Latin America.

Led by experienced entrepreneurs, who together blend their technology, commercial and leadership skills into a world beating team, the company develops and markets Wattwave, a unique powerline communications protocol designed to be the robust, efficient and secure communications backbone for smart buildings. Unlike competing wireless and wired technologies, Wattwave offers the long-range, robust, low cost and easy-to-embed communications needs of smart appliances, lighting and heating controls. As a powerline-based technology, Wattwave is far less susceptible to signal interference and propagation issues in homes, and it was designed from the ground up to offer unparalleled range. Wattwave is also ten times cheaper to embed than competing technologies such as ZigBee, making it a very attractive proposition for OEMs looking to develop connected Smart Home devices, in particular lower cost devices such as LED light bulbs or smartplugs. Four patents are pending on core principles of Wattwave, offering enModus strong IP protection. After raising £150,000 in Angel funding in 2010 and a first venture capital round of £1 million in 2011, enModus recently raised a further £1.5m of investment which will allow the company to cost-optimise Wattwave and take it to market. Our ultimate goal is for enModus to become the leading provider of powerline chipsets and software technology for smart appliances and smart building solutions – similar in business strategy and approach to Qualcomm CDMA Technologies in the wireless market. enModus is a graduate of the SETsquared start-up incubator, and is a member of Microsoft's BizSpark and ARM's Connected Community programmes.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Real Estate, Software",3,11-50,"Andy Heaton, John Spear, Phil Young",6,,2017-10-03,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,5650000,GBP,8214089,5650000,GBP,8214089,"Development Bank of Wales, Breed Reply, Oxygen House, intu Properties",2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Baggage touches both pain points; representing a direct cost in terms of fuel, landing duties and handling costs & an indirect cost as a barrier to turning around more planes within the limited daily slots. To combat the cost of handling baggage, airlines are seeking to reduce the amount checked whilst charging significantly more for that which is. The CEO of Europe's largest low cost airline has stated he will “price luggage out of the hold”.  Baggage however is not only a problem for European low cost airlines; in the last decade the revenue achieved from baggage fees in the USA has grown from $400M to $4B. One journalist described the modern traveller as being fleeced like sheep and herded like cattle,  checked baggage fees are growing, hand luggage only flights are coming and baggage allowances are falling; despite this over 1.5 billion flights will be taken in 2014.

Their software allows companies, local authorities and schools to understand, encourage and reward healthy behaviours. Primary provision is an online, client-branded portal which allows employees/ residents/students to learn about Health & Wellbeing, form teams, set goals and, most importantly, log their efforts through the site and a GPS mobile app (iOS and Android). Doing so allows both the individual and company to track stats derived from that behaviour. It also permits organisational leaderboards (teams, departments, offices) fostering friendly competition and allows the client (and external brands) to reward this behaviour. Users accrue ""Yomps"" - akin to an Air Miles for being healthy - which can be redeemed for discounts at high-street retailers, online stores, and even donations to charity. Their main revenue-stream is an annual SAAS licence fee paid by the Corporate / Local Authority. Additional revenue streams are advertising / brand partner fees (CPA / CPC); content sponsorship; and affiliate links / sales - all of which have a positive correlation with user-base.","Administrative Services, Gaming, Health Care, Information Technology, Software, Sustainability, Transportation, Travel and Tourism",2,1-10,"Ant Ganjou, Ry Morgan",2,M&A,2015-11-02,,,,Non-equity Assistance,200000,GBP,302198,Seed,200000,GBP,302198,200000,GBP,302198,"Pitch@Palace, EIT Digital Accelerator, Oksana Stowe",,3,,Was Acquired,Yomp acquired by Reward Gateway,https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/reward-gateway-acquires-yomp--f9850a80,Reward Gateway,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reward-gateway,2016-03-08,day,,,,Acquisition,Cash & Stock,Private,,,,,,,,,,,1

Just as Kickstarter is transforming funding for the creative sector, they are addressing the other side of the  creative equation: people and resources.  The creative industries, which ranges from Games and Music through to Advertising, Design and the  Performing Arts, commonly faces two problems: a lack of access to the resources people need to start their projects or businesses, and fragmented networks, isolated by discipline or location. For example, a web designer might not know the web developers they need and having a network in Los Angeles is not necessarily what you need when you are putting on a conference in London.  With The Backscratchers, users can find and connect with creative professionals across disciplines and locations, working via resource exchange or payment and building their reputation within the sector. The  platform bridges the gap that currently exists between professional networks and creative portfolio websites.

Bike HUD, the company's flagship product, is a heads-up display based around a microcontroller. Bike HUD shows speed, engine revs., gear selection, indicators and more in a small display that sits just below the rider's forward view. In normal use, Bike HUD is intended to operate in the rider's peripheral vision to minimise distraction and ensure attention remains on the road. The rider can also 'read' the digits and graphics directly should he/she so wish. Bike HUD has three core operating modes: commuting, touring and racing. Each mode presents a tailored view of information to the rider, for example, racing (or track day) mode includes an indicator of whether the last lap was faster or slower than the one before; commuting mode flashes the display when the bike's indicators are on.

Initial work focused upon establishing the performance characteristics of the rotor at 1:20 prototype scale, financed initially by the University, and then, for a second time, with more detailed instrumentation for stress and other measurements, financed by the Technology Strategy Board and by the company's shareholders. Subsequent work has involved developing designs for full scale turbines, combined into tidal fences, undertaken with supply chain partners who are each leaders in the offshore and tidal energy arenas. Kepler has no direct economic competitors in providing access to tidal stream resource where first generation turbines are not economic, and represents the first disruptive technology to positively impact on the economics of power production from this predictable source of sustainable energy. This is because the Kepler turbine is very different to all others on the market - it is larger, scaleable, intrinsically more powerful and patented. It has been optimised to open up new resources in low tidal stream velocity flows (below 2.5 m/s), the most commonly found current strength in coastal waters across the globe. The rotor is deployed in standardised units within a tidal fence arrangement, with the key advantage of generating revenue incrementally during the construction phase, to provide certainty in realising expected equity returns.",Energy,,11-50,,2,Seed,2013-05-01,,,,Grant,,,,Seed,,,,,,,"Innovate UK, Oxford University Innovation",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
