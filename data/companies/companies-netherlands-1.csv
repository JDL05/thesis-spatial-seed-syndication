Spotr.ai monitors and inspects over 250.000 buildings in the Netherlands and recently launched in the UK with 10 prominent UK housing corporations that will start inspecting their real estate portfolios with Spotr’s software solution. Spotr.ai offers a platform for banks, insurance companies, large real-estate owners, and the government to monitor building characteristics in a fast, precise, and easily accessible platform. This contributes to optimizing their client’s portfolios and activities. “It’s about knowing and understanding your portfolio.” Says Dirk Huibers, CEO at Spotr.ai. “Think of the dimensions, quantities, and conditions of buildings and their specific components. This information is crucial to make smart decisions when achieving sustainability goals. But it’s also about asking yourself the basic questions. On which buildings can you place external wall insulation? How many floors does a building have? Can you still reach that high floor with a fire truck? Are there trees close to the gutters that could cause water damage? You need accurate data to make the right decisions for your portfolio and wallet. And that data simply doesn’t exist today.”  With only 8% of buildings currently being inspected every year due to budget and time constraints of building owners and facility managers, there’s much to gain. “It’s our ambition to inspect every building in the world every year,” says Huibers. “In the largest global sector in the world, a small deviation can have a major impact on maintenance costs and valuations. Our smart software can make better, faster, and cheaper budget estimations than humans alone, which makes us a reliable and trustworthy partner.”","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",3,1-10,"Dirk Huibers, Marieke Dijksma, Tara Campagne",2,Early Stage Venture,2024-01-23,4500000,EUR,4885898,Series A,4500000,EUR,4885898,Series A,7000000,EUR,7917303,7000000,EUR,7917303,"Volta Ventures, InnovationQuarter, Concrete Venture Capital, EDF Pulse Croissance",2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

YOM is pioneering the first cloud gaming infrastructure (DePIN), streaming games, white-label experiences and entirely new entertainment formats at scale.  Leveraging a distributed network of gaming machines (nodes), YOM offers global low-latency, near-zero costs cloud gaming to any device and channel. Node operators on the YOM network sell their gaming machine cycles to the network, earning passive revenues, up to 480% APY/license on a deflationary (!) token. Since the network eliminates the need for gaming hardware to access games (e.g. Xbox, Playstation) and other conversion killers (Steam, app store), YOM massively expands the funnel for studios and game developers alike - enabling them to focus their efforts on building good games, fast. What Makes YOM Unique? YOM’s DePIN infrastructure is a significant advantage compared to other cloud gaming solutions because it eliminates the need for expensive data centers and traditional cloud providers, which can reduce cloud gaming development and deployment costs by a factor of 10x-50x.  Furthermore, developers can use YOM's SDK/webapp to end-to-end deploy and manage any Unreal Engine-based interactive multiplayer experience. As a result, creators retain ownership and full control over their source-code, object-code, and gateways of their own projects without surrendering massive fees (e.g. 30% to the Apple store). History of YOM? YOM was founded in 2021 as both a DePIN network and content provider. In 2024, the team focused the business solely on the gaming infrastructure, and left the content creation aspects to their valued business partners. That change in the business model came with the appointment of a new leadership team with experience in sales, web3, gaming, and venture capital.  The change in business strategy and the focus on the DePIN caught the attention of Outlier Ventures.  With the backing of Borderless Capital, the Outlier Ventures DePIN Base Camp program accepted YOM into their inaugural cohort. This program has enhanced the business and technical model the team put forth, and will be paying dividends in the years to come. What’s Next for YOM? YOM is currently decentralising and scaling its network.Its goal for 2025 is to be able to scale the network to millions of users at very low costs on a single shard, fully distributed. This is a feat unprecedented in AAA gaming history, allowing for a massive expansion of the gaming market to any device, mobile, laptop, streaming service, that has access to the internet. In the coming quarters the sales team will be onboarding major games projects in the web2 and web3 space to the network. They will be working with video streaming services to offer interactive experiences through their platform. And YOM will be providing incentives for independent game and content developers to bring their work to the YOM DePIN.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Content and Publishing, Gaming, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software, Video",3,11-50,"Andrew Pringle, Jeff Outlaw, Jorrit Velzeboer",1,Seed,2024-06-25,550000,USD,550000,Pre-Seed,550000,USD,550000,Pre-Seed,550000,USD,550000,550000,USD,550000,"Borderless Capital, Outlier Ventures",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore Codean built a review environment, that makes security experts work 2 times faster; up to 10 times for certain tasks. And it automates mundane analysis tasks, so security experts can focus on finding vulnerabilities. Our review environment is for a security expert what an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is for software engineers. Most security experts use an IDE for software analysis, even though that's made for software development. Instead, the environment we built is tailor made for security review: it has features ranging from keeping track what is reviewed while doing delta’s, to symbiotic taint analysis, to easy report composition. The result: less mundane work, more fun. We also have a small team of security analysts ourselves, who perform pentests and continuous security review. Their main added value for us is that we test the review environment with our own people: to make it the best product ever. Since early 2021 we have been using the review environment for code review. Since 2022 we provide the review environment as a SaaS product for security experts, whitebox ethical hackers, and everybody else who wants to find more code vulnerabilities in less time.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",2,1-10,"Arthur Tolsma, Kevin Valk",2,Seed,2022-08-11,400000,EUR,412722,Grant,1000000,EUR,1089518,Seed,1000000,EUR,1089518,1400000,EUR,1502240,"European Commission, TIIN Capital",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The emissions created by Europeans cheese consumption alone is the equivalent to Belgium’s total emissions.  Our new bean-based range produces up to 6 times less CO2 than the dairy alternatives it’s replacing. We believe that holistic solutions are needed to create major changes in our food system – having recently secured B Corp status and begun growing beans in the Netherlands in 2022, we’re on track to address many of the problems at their root cause. In May 2022 we completed a 2m EUR pre-Series A. The raise will enable us to bring our delicious, beautifully branded range of PBC’s to 3 new markets: the UK, Germany and the Nordics, bringing in senior hires and continuing on our quest to become the world’s first net-positive plant-based cheese company. The investment was led by early-stage investor Rockstart and PINC, Paulig’s venture arm. Döhler and Feast Ventures also participated as co-investors alongside a number of angels. ---- Don’t take our word for it…  Marika King, Head of PINC, says, “Willicroft is by far the tastiest plant-based cheese range we have come across. It has a more nutritious and sustainable ingredient list than most alternatives available today and a high-powered team with traction in Europe, so we could not be more excited to support this venture.” Mark Durno, Managing Partner AgriFood, Rockstart, says, “Willicroft is taking plant-based dairy alternatives to the next level. Alongside making delicious products, they are helping farmers to transition to sustainable production by enabling a local supply chain without the need for monocropping or highly processed ingredients. They have spent the last years understanding their consumers and their footprint, and the next phase will be to put those learnings to scale.”","Food and Beverage, Manufacturing",,1-10,,1,Seed,2022-05-17,2000000,EUR,2109800,Pre-Seed,2000000,EUR,2109800,Pre-Seed,2000000,EUR,2109800,2000000,EUR,2109800,"Rockstart, Döhler Ventures, PINC, Feast Creative Foods",2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Iristrace enables enterprises to better manage their business risks with flexible control frames for their operations that can easily be changed as processes evolve.  By subscribing to its SaaS platform, teams can collaborate better on quality and brand standards, on compliance programs and on safety procedures. They can also use the platform to react faster to exceptions and incidents.  With Iristrace, business experts without IT knowledge easily design and roll out their controls across their organisation in a record time. They can determine themselves whether controls are scheduled automatically, triggered by events or used in self-service.

With the Iristrace mobile app, employees become much more agile, while management and subject matter experts receive real time information on their tablet or desktop through the Iristrace platform. Customers save time and money by moving away from their disparate traditional tools and methods such as email, messenger, spreadsheets and slide decks or even pen and paper that many companies still use today. Tedious tasks such as chasing for information and reporting are greatly simplified.  The benefits include a faster implementation of strategy, better staff and supplier engagement on the company’s objectives, improved compliance, shorter learning cycles, lower costs and a far superior customer experience as a result. Tens of leading companies in sectors such as retail, fashion, hospitality and automotive are benefitting from Iristrace’s platform to mitigate risks and benchmark their multiple business locations.

Today, mental illness affects one in four people at some point during their lives, and is often ignored and stigmatized. Many patients don't have access to timely, quality mental healthcare services when they need it, and for many, the cost of accessing such care is prohibitive. Also, mental health professionals have limited capacity in treating patients, and, in developing countries, mental healthcare services are practically nonexistent. X²AI’s mission is to change the status quo, and provide on-demand and accessible quality mental healthcare for everyone, regardless of geographic location or income level. Introducing Tess™ A conversation with Tess, X²AI’s psychological AI, is just a text message away, administering psychotherapy and psychoeducation through a variety of existing technology-based communications, including SMS, instant messaging platforms, and web browsers, instantly, 24/7, when and where the mental healthcare provider isn't. Tess automatically checks in with the patient and learns their emotional signals during conversations, also communicating this to the therapist who is then able to intervene or escalate treatment based on certain triggers. With therapist oversight, Tess delivers therapy education, health-related reminders and mental health coping mechanisms that are personalized for each patient, based on their emotional profile. Access to Tess is based on the patient's needs between scheduled appointments and at a lower cost than regular therapy sessions, and the ability to scale Tess across a large patient base further reduces costs for healthcare providers, payors and patients.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Health Care, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Science and Engineering, Software",2,1-10,"Eugene Bann, Michiel Rauws",3,Early Stage Venture,2019-06-01,,,,Series A,,,,Series A,,,,100000,USD,100000,"American Family Insurance Institute for Corporate and Social Impact, Singularity University Ventures",,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Both your hands are tied. Criminals keep changing the game, while you have to play by the rules. Lots of rules. Meanwhile your business keeps accelerating.  To keep up and comply at the same time means adding layer upon layer of complexity. Leading to higher costs and ever more cumbersome processes, burdening your clients. Clearly, this way of thinking isn’t working, so shouldn’t we rethink the problem? Here’s what we think. Financial criminals are always looking for loopholes to stay ahead of being detected. Normal people aren’t. So why base your approach on exceptions and not on the rule? When you focus on regular customer behavior, the anomalies clearly stick out. This may sound simple. It is also very effective. You drastically reduce false positives and increase true positives as previously undetected patterns now become visible. So you can identify the right cases faster, at lower cost. This is how it works. Our automated machine learning technology generates detection models. Based on your own raw data and regulatory requirements. It deploys these models in your transaction monitoring system of choice. Because the value isn’t in the system, it’s in the detection models running on it. They enhance the monitoring system to better identify known and yet unknown financial crime.  This makes everyone’s lives so much easier. Your case analysts can now spend their time on meaningful investigations. Your data scientists can get rid of their backlog and focus on other, more bank-specific risks. Your compliance team can explain these transparent models to regulators. Think white box, not black box. At Sygno we approach financial crime from a clear-cut premise: most of your customers are not criminals. By looking at it this way, we make transaction monitoring more manageable and effective. So you can catch crooks, comply and be in full control.  Why lose any more sleep over it?

Conventional materials such as cotton require an immense amount of resources, semi-finished products travel all over the globe for various steps in the production process, and overproduction is anchored in the fundaments of the business model of fashion brands. Through the NEFFA production method, design is done directly in 3D, offering an innovative way to rethink fashion design. A digital design interface offers options to apply all kinds of parametric textures in the blink of an eye. The final design is turned into an affordable and recyclable 3D mold with a variety of digital technologies. This is possible because the manufacturing method does not require any high heat or pressure so the molds can be like blisters. In the meantime, the biomass is grown in large fermentation tanks. NEFFA currently works with mycelium – creating a material called MycoTEX – but their system can also work with other biomaterials that can be grown through liquid fermentation, such as algae or even collagen.","Community and Lifestyle, Manufacturing",,1-10,,1,Seed,2024-01-30,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,"Capricorn Partners, ROM Utrecht Region, DOEN Participaties, PDS Ventures",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
