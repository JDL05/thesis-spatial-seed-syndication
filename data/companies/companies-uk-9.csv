SSI is a new paradigm for exchanging trusted digital data related to people, companies, and things in a much more secure and privacy-preserving fashion that puts people in control of their data. Far too often, digital identity services online are slow, user-hostile, and expensive for businesses to process. It costs anywhere from $10 onwards to verify the identity of people online, and upwards of $100s for corporate entities. Over the past few years many startups, established ID companies, governments, and non-profits have used decentralised identity to give people more control back of their data and make its use secure and transparent. BUT... What is currently missing is an incentives layer for the self-sovereign identity ecosystem, which hampers adoption. We use blockchain to create a decentralised network for digital identity payments. Once we build this, we will build tools to allow digital ID payments agnostic of ledger. Our initial target segment is B2B, to any companies building products on decentralised ID for people and companies. We will work with these ID companies to integrate verim's digital ID payment rails and network. Our future roadmap includes plans for enterprise and SaaS software that allows large/mid- cap organisations that want to monetise their digital ID issuance. Our mission is to make digital identity more accessible, inclusive, and commercially sustainable. Our core product is a blockchain network that makes exchanging and paying for trusted data easy, inclusive, and secure. We built this core on blockchain technology, as we believe no single company should be in control of such critical Web infrastructure. Our vision is that this new form of digital identity applies beyond just the financial industry and will be transformative for almost every industry sector imaginable. Through our network, anyone can verify identities quickly and securely with the ability for organisations checking the data to be compensated for their work.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Payments, Privacy and Security, Software",2,11-50,"Ankur Banerjee, Fraser Edwards",2,Seed,2021-09-22,2600000,USD,2600000,Seed,2600000,USD,2600000,Seed,3300000,USD,3300000,3300000,USD,3300000,"Outlier Ventures, Double Peak Group, SkyVision Capital, Bixin Ventures, MiH Ventures",2,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The volume of mobile data traffic is exploding and 5G will have to fulfill a growing variety of performance requirements, ranging from extreme mobile broadband to low-latency automotive IoT. To accommodate such demands, enhanced flexibility in managing the infrastructure is needed. Network slicing allows operators to customize resources on a per-service basis, by virtually partitioning the physical infrastructure, thereby enabling new lucrative revenue streams. However, without deep intelligence into the traffic flowing over slices, and where it originates, it is impossible to effectively and efficiently monetize them.  To address this need, our Microscope software uses AI to perform mobile traffic decomposition. Microscope identifies and quantifies the nature and source of individual streams (e.g. Netflix, Google cloud services, Facebook, etc; down to individual base station) from aggregate streams.

You own the asset, not a block of time. Flyway deals with all the hassle of ownership, so that you simply land and enjoy your city getaway. HOW WE DO IT BEHIND THE SCENES We identify top-notch properties, in top locations that we can supercharge with smart features. We then set up an LTD (Limited Liability Company) that acquires the property. That LTD is split into 12 equal shares, and each share costs 1/12 of the total house price. A buyer can buy up to half of the property (6 shares).  WHAT YOU GET You get ownership of a second home suited to your budget and needs. Whether you use it for leisure, work or you simply believe in the property’s potential as an investment, you have the rights to the asset. You can use and resell your share when you want.

When we asked them for their thoughts on our research priorities we were frequently told that what was really needed was a safe and effective non-drug treatment for tic disorder that could be used outside of the clinic and gave individuals control over their tics. This led directly to us focusing on the use of peripheral nerve stimulation as a means of bringing about changes in the brain networks associated with the production of tics. We demonstrated that delivering rhythmic patterns of mild electrical stimulation to the median nerve at the wrist could be used to increase the power and the synchronicity of the brain oscillations (rhythms) associated with the suppression of movements, and that this type of stimulation was sufficient to dramatically reduce the frequency of tics and remove the urge-to-tic in individuals with tic disorders. Importantly, we also showed that this type of stimulation did not materially affect the execution of volitional (intentional) movements or impair cognitive functions such as attention.",Health Care,,11-50,,2,Seed,2024-07-31,500000,GBP,642645,Seed,500000,GBP,642645,Seed,3842645,USD,3842645,3842645,USD,3842645,"Eos, Midlands Engine Investment Fund",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

It features a multi-chain NFT platform, a brand dashboard and companion app to take NFTs into retail, stadium and festival environments. Fayre provides a comprehensive suite of tools for brands to participate and engage with their current and future audiences in real life and across the Metaverse. • A multi-chain marketplace. • A dashboard for brands. • An NFT membership club. • Zero transaction fees. • A companion app. • Metaverse commerce. All these modules are wrapped in a friendly UX that hides the underlying complexity of smart contracts. At the core of this ecosystem is the $FAYRE utility and governance token that loops together on all sides of the NFT market. $FAYRE is a utility and governance token that powers the Fayre Marketplace. It has rich functionality for every side of the market: buyers, sellers, and creators. More specifically, the token is used for: • Sending rewards • Payments on the marketplace • Discounts on transaction fees • Governance voting • Staking Together, this combination of functionalities should simultaneously provide ample velocity (through the use as rewards and payments) and remove excessive supply from the circulation (via staking). Fayre’s aim is to build a long term ecosystem. Short term an NFT Marketplace with 0% transaction fees. Medium term providing utility and governance via the $FAYRE token. And long term building of Web3 modular components and P2E functionality on the Metaverse.  Fayre was founded by Luis Carranza and Fernando Torres.  Luis is a serial entrepreneur and community builder. He started his career building digital strategy and innovation departments at various marketing agencies, helping brands navigate digital, social and mobile integration. Later, Luis launched London Fintech Week and Blockchain Week, as well as founded Fintech Worldwide Limited, which was sold in 2019. Luis served as the marketing director of Boson Protocol, where he was immersed in NFTs. He soon launched Fayre to help brands enter Web3 and engage with fans. Fernando is a technologist and entrepreneur with 15 years of experience in software development. Fernando is passionate about media creation, decentralization, and storytelling, and takes a holistic view of technology and product development. Previously, Fernando won the NFTHack by ETHGlobal competition in the SuperRare category.

Home Movers can feel isolated, stressed, and out of control when buying and selling homes. Their emotions during the process can go from euphoric when receiving an offer or agreeing a deal on the perfect home, to angry and frustrated during the legal element of the process. They often feel out of the loop and not communicated with by their chosen Conveyancer. The Conveyancer can feel stressed and frustrated by the lack of progress by other key stakeholders in the transaction. When Home Movers chase their Conveyancer for news or updates (even when there aren’t any) the Conveyancer ends up feeling frustrated and hassled. If we had a system where the Home Mover could be in control of the administrative element of their Home Move, and the Conveyancer only had to focus on the legal aspect of the transaction, then both key players in the process would benefit and the overall transaction could be more engaging, less stressful and could be completed in a shorter timeframe.
