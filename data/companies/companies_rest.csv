Havelock,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/havelock,Active,,"Consulting, Information Technology, Software","Sofia, Grad Sofiya, Bulgaria",Havelock is ready to use production management software.,"172,964","European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,Less than $1M,2019-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,https://www.havelock.app/,,https://www.facebook.com/Havelocksoftware,https://www.linkedin.com/company/havelocksoftware,"Havelock is a work management and collaboration platform that keeps all important information updated in real-time and stored in one place. Havelock offers the simplest way for multi-department companies to manage many projects effectively from one place and have quick access to all project information updated in real-time. Culture of Action - Plan dynamically and stop re-arranging your target deadlines to match reality - Plan and schedule only actionable milestones - Put all actionable milestones in a single “Action hub” - Assign only actionable tasks - Organize all communication around tasks to make it easily traceable Actionable dependencies Before you continue reading, let’s explain what we mean by “actionable”, because it is a word that you would hear a lot. When a milestone or a task is actionable, it means you can start to work on it immediately without worrying that you have to wait for someone else to finish their work. Also, it means that all necessary files and documents to execute the task are at your disposal. The purpose of Actionable Dependencies is simple – to inform PMs when milestones become actionable (workable) or in other words, it’s time for action. Dependencies are set automatically when all preceding milestones are executed. Most of our competitors use dependencies to automatically reschedule tasks or milestones but we believe that automatic rescheduling of initial plans is a wrong practice. We keep the initial plans unchanged for a reason – to compare them with the real situation. Comparison is the best way for a company to learn, improve and build sustainable know-how. Dynamic Reminders Actionable Dependencies and Dynamic Reminders are at the very core of our patentpending methodology. Dynamic Reminders are very important. Imagine a project manager (PM) has to, well, manage 100 projects with 30 milestones each, and a number of tasks related to each milestone and assigned to different teams. Of course, we expect the PM to react to every single change and keep all projects updated with a 100% match with the real situation. In other words, the PM must monitor nearly 3,000 milestones every day and have instant information about all emerging deviations so that he can update all unrealistic target deadlines with achievable ones. Monitoring 3,000 milestones every day!? Is it possible and what happens in reality? When an actionable dependency is activated, the system automatically adds a dynamic reminder to the milestone in question. The dynamic reminder serves as a guarantee that the PM will be immediately informed when an action is needed. When a milestone is executed the system automatically informs the PM which other milestones have just become actionable. As a result, the PM doesn’t have to monitor 3,000 milestones because they manage only actionable ones – or less than 5% based on our experience. Projects become transparent and informative as never before. We can see the initial plans (hopes), the execution dates (reality), the delays (comparison between the two), and the next actionable steps. Do we need more? Dynamic Reminders Hub The process of domestication looks at its best in the Dynamic Reminders Hub – the main playground of a PM. The Dynamic Reminders Hub collects the dynamic reminders for all projects, prioritised by the date of the required action (for “Today”, “Tomorrow”, and so on). Our experience shows that less than 1% of all existing milestones are scheduled for “Today”. The result? A PM’s productivity jumps from five to six times. One PM can easily deal with 200-300 simultaneously running projects (reported by our clients). Nothing has to be remembered, yet nothing is forgotten – the Dynamic Reminders Hub does it for you. Actionable tasks only, please! From the Dynamic Reminders Hub, a PM starts the execution process of actionable milestones by creating and assigning tasks. This is the very first moment tasks appear in our concept. It is wrong to create and assign tasks before it is possible to start to work on them – it only adds noise to the system. “Non-actionable” tasks in the daily “to-do” lists of employees create not only a stressful environment but also ruin the credibility of such lists. On the other hand, the logical consequence of dealing with actionable milestones is that all created tasks are also actionable. This is a huge game-changer. Only a month after kickoff, our client reported 100% actionable tasks registered in the system – there were no tasks “on hold” or “waiting for something to happen”. What’s more, communication noise was reduced by three-four times. Task-related communication & escalation All communication in Havelock happens only on the task-level – each task has its own communication channel – which facilitates the search for information. Additionally, each project, milestone, and task have a library with related files. This way, all communication history is preserved, it’s easily searchable and increases the system’s transparency. If a task assignee has questions or needs clarification, they can send a direct message to the person in concern. If an assignee is not able to execute the task by the required deadline, they can request a deadline change. Upon request, the PM decides they need to escalate the issue.","Information Technology, Professional Services, Software",3,11-50,"Boicho Kojuharov, Marin Kojuharov, Venera Alexandrova",1,Seed,2018-11-27,50000,EUR,56486,Seed,50000,EUR,56486,Seed,50000,EUR,56486,50000,EUR,56486,Eleven Ventures,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The software comes as an utterly hands-off solution - we architect, deploy, tune, monitor, and maintain your StorPool Storage system so that your users experience a speedy and reliable service. StorPool Storage systems are ideal for storing and managing the data of primary workloads that demand extreme reliability and low latency - databases, web servers, virtual desktops, real-time analytics, and mission-critical software. StorPool simplifies our customers’ cloud infrastructure, removes all the pains they experienced with legacy storage products, and supercharges their revenue and profits. Our customers’ specific benefits from StorPool Storage vary depending on their use cases, technology stacks, and scale. However, the core capabilities of StorPool are that it is reliable, agile, managed with ease, utterly hands-off, and speedy. Under the hood, StorPool builds out shared-storage pools out of DC-grade storage drives directly attached to standard servers to create the ultimate storage solution. These pools provide standard block device interfaces to the virtualised, containerised, or bare-metal workloads running in a cloud. StorPool has native plug-ins for Cloud Management Platforms like OpenStack, OpenNebula, CloudStack, Kubernetes, and OnApp. It also supports VMware, Oracle VM, Hyper-V, XenServer, and almost all other technology stacks. We designed StorPool Storage for large-scale deployments, but it has efficient resource consumption and can start small. Each cluster scales seamlessly online - adding drives or servers expands both its capacity and performance. Adjusting StorPool volume size and performance also happens online without disrupting user workloads. The updates for StorPool are also carried out online, without any interruptions to your services. StorPool doesn’t need specialised hardware components to deliver all of the above.","Hardware, Internet Services, Software",3,51-100,"Boyan Ivanov, Boyan Krosnov, Yanko Yankulov",2,Early Stage Venture,2014-02-05,,,,Series A,,,,Series A,200000,EUR,263255,200000,EUR,263255,"LAUNCHub Ventures, IT Web AD",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,9

This is especially true for SMBs and all the crafters and makers out there. Instead of spending big on traditional advertising, brands should engage their peers with great content. To fix the industry, they created Edgar. Edgar gives brands the tools and access to the best creatives (brand storytellers, writers, illustrators), so that they can delight their customers with awesome stories.  StoryMarket is the place where Edgar hosts a hand-picked selection of storytellers from around the world. From copywriters, journalists, editors, illustrators, photographers to animators, outreach experts and community managers, they have the talent needed to craft awesome brand stories. Edgar handles strategy, management, creation and distribution of content.  The scope of the campaign depends on each customer. Creating the brief and defining the scope is as easy as ordering a frozen yogurt. From a single piece of content, to a set of Instagram/Vine videos, or dedicated storytelling expert that sticks with the brand forever and ever. Edgar makes sure the content is nothing less than perfect and is delivered to you in record time (first piece no later than 10 working days).  The creatives and freelancers working with Edgar benefit from their lightweight yet powerful storytelling tools. StoryCrafter is a tool for short, visual stories. Stories take the form of visualized storylines with interactive elements that boost engagement. You create the story by drag and dropping your photos, Instagrams, Vine or YouTube videos and spicing it up with short captions. Brands equip the stories with their contact, brief information and a call to action at the end of the story. Etsy artists for example sell their products straight from the story, while wineries invite people for a wine tasting. Sharing and embedding is done in seconds, while they make sure the story looks and feels exactly the same wherever. Be it web, mobile or tablets.  With each story, the Edgar community is growing. A community of freelance storytellers that Edgar empowers with tools and opportunity to be rewarded for their skills. And a community of active visitors who return to be inspired by great content every single day.  Brands and individuals benefit greatly from Edgar as it helps them engage their potential customers. And helps them convert existing customers into fans. At the end, there’s no more powerful instrument than people telling stories about your brand.","Commerce and Shopping, Media and Entertainment, Other, Sales and Marketing",3,1-10,"Damjan Obal, Marko Zabreznik, Marusa Novak",2,Seed,2014-07-09,25000,EUR,34103,Seed,25000,EUR,34103,Seed,69103,USD,69103,69103,USD,69103,"Eleven Ventures, Ivaylo Simov, Daniel Tomov, Dilyan Dimitrov",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The company’s software technology steps on WebRTC and HTML5 and solves complex problems such as client-assisted delivery and HLS & DASH playback in HTML5 without the use of plugins. Its flagship product Viblast PDN (short from peer-assisted delivery network) is the winner of Best Innovation 2014 at WebRTC Global Summit 2014. It optimizes video delivery to large numbers of simultaneous viewers through patent-pending peer-assisted technology. It scales real-time, improves QoE parameters and relieves last-mile video traffic congestion while reducing reliance on costly streaming infrastructure.  Targeted at broadcasters and content providers, Viblast PDN enables the delivery of live and on-demand high-definition video to any device and platform in a massively scalable and cost-effective way, achieving bandwidth savings of up to 70%. The technology seamlessly complements existing delivery solutions (CDN/in-house deployments).  Viblast Player is the company’s solution to the challenge of HLS & MPEG-DASH playback in HTML5 plugin-free. It is one of very few available technologies able to play adaptive bitrate (ABR) streams without Flash in HTML5. Besides ABR playback of live and on-demand content, it handles encrypted HLS and DRM-protected DASH streams. Viblast is especially well-timed with the introduction of 4K, which will generate substantial traffic when adopted on a mass scale.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software, Video",4,1-10,"Lubomir Chorbadjiev, Nikolay Dimitrov, Stefan Dimov, Svetlin Mladenov",3,Seed,2015-01-07,50000,EUR,59190,Seed,50000,EUR,59190,Seed,200000,EUR,264785,200000,EUR,264785,LAUNCHub Ventures,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Our product is a system that monitors its wearer’s walking and running behavior. For the moment it is targeted towards hobbyist runners and joggers as we strive to help them improve their results and provide the necessary means to minimize the risk of injuries. Our system builds a diary with data about the runner's training sessions, focused around information about the dynamics of the foot to facilitate the former. To address the latter we plan to look for particular patterns that might be a sign of fatigue and upon detecting them warn the jogger about the increased risk of trauma. Our research with joggers so far has shown that they usually sustain injures as a result of overtraining and improper selection of the training load. Our system consists of a smart pair of insoles with embedded sensors that collect data and stream it wirelessly to the user’s mobile device. The information is then processed to extract important events and patterns, which are delivered to our servers via the internet. At the same time, a visualization about the wearer’s walking behavior is shown on her mobile device screen in real time. Upon receiving data from the smartphone, our online system uses it to build a progress diary through informative and appealing visualizations.
