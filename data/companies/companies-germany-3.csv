Most organisations use less than 5% of what they collect, are not able not commercialise their most valuable asset and instead waste millions on excess storage. To address this challenge, we have developed SiaSearch the category-leading search engine for petabyte-scale automotive data. Our technology automatically structures raw sensor data based on semantic attributes and keywords such as cut-ins, crowded intersections or dangerous overtaking. This metadata is powerful. By searching it, we can eliminate the time wasted on manual data crawling, automate the decision of what data to store and provide intelligent suggestions of what data would be most valuable to collect. With SiaSearch we are helping our customers to build smaller, higher density data sets.

Our solution reveals forgery and falsification of images and videos with high accuracy. Images and videos that were taken out of context and reused with modified metadata, so called shallow fakes have been around for some time, however the advancement of AI and wide availability of CPU/GPU power has enabled bad actors to easily forge videos, that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones and can be used for malicious and unethical purposes. Videos have been regarded as proof that something has happened; however, today anyone can swap faces of politicians or other people just by following a step-by-step guide available online. With time, this will only get easier and videos like these can spread like wildfire on social media, just like fake news in 2016, but now on steroids, in the form of fake videos. This could possibly happen already in 2020, just in time for the next US elections. Our solution allows media outlets (online, TV, news agencies, journalists) and platforms (social media sites, video sharing platforms and websites) to check the authenticity of images and videos, preventing misinformation of the public and all unwanted consequences related to forged content.

By using artificial intelligence algorithms, our solution translates the planning of the clinician from the computer viewer to the patient without the need of expensive and complicated robotic systems. Once the clinician defines a needle trajectory, the app will indicate where to place the sterilized-disposable needle-guide to fulfill his planning. Hence, less punctures are needed, the procedure time is reduced and risk for patient and clinician is reduced. The complete solution of assistance tools and biopsy needle can be acquired at a price similar to normal biopsy needles in the market and enables clinicians to perform safe, precise, intuitive and efficient cancer diagnosis and treatment.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Hardware, Health Care, Manufacturing, Navigation and Mapping, Science and Engineering, Software",2,1-10,"Juan Sebastián Sánchez López, Sinja Lagotzki",2,Seed,2022-07-25,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,"bmp Ventures, IBG Beteiligungsgesellschaft Sachsen-Anhalt, Kristin Lüdemann, Ralf Lüdemann",1,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
