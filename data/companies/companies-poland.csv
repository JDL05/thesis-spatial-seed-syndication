It is the only company globally working on technology enabling a gradual implementation of Hyperloop-inspired solutions as an upgrade for the railway industry. The company has developed a unique, patent-pending magrail technology, which allows modernizing existing conventional railway lines to a standard of passive magnetic railways, reaching speed of  300 kph (186 mph) on normal lines and 415 kph (258 mph) on HSR lines. The magrail system allows keeping the functionality of conventional railways on a modernized line (railway operators can depreciate their existing rolling stock). Magrail can be subsequently transformed into a vacuum system – hyperrail, reaching speed of 600 kph (373 mph) on normal lines and 1000 kph (621 mph) on HSR lines. The third generation is hyperloop – vacuum magnetic railways built within new transportation corridors for top speed of 1200 kph (746 mph), using subsystems tested in the first two generations. Capex for retrofitting railway infrastructure to a magrail standard are estimated to ca. EUR 6-8 million per km, which is comparable to the cost of building a new highway and up to 60-70% lower than the average cost of building a new HSR line in the EU. Energy costs will be lower by ca. 13% for the speed of 300 kph (186 mph) compared to HSR, whole for the speed of 415 kph (258 mph) magrail needs the same amount of energy than HSR currently for 300 kph (186 mph). The maintenance costs will be ca. 25% lower than for HSR, due to elimination of friction of mechanical elements at high speeds. The company was founded in 2017 and until mid-2019 it submitted 8 patent applications. In the first half of 2019 it secured an EUR 3.8 million grant in Poland and raised EUR 334 thousands during the first Polish equity crowdfunding campaign on a UK-based platform Seedrs.  Currently a Proof of Concept (PoC) is almost completed (ca. 50 m. long test track, which will be demonstrated in Q4.2019)., while at the turn of 2020 and 2021 a demonstration of the first full-scale prototype is planned. Corporate partners include TME Transfer Multisort Electronics and Microsoft. Key member of the R&D team is prof. Jacek F Gieras who has conducted research on Shinkansen SCMaglev at the Central Japan Railway Company. The company has got an international Advisory Board, including: Dorota Raben - expert in logistics & the former President of the Board of the Maritime Port of Gdansk SA, Amos Ron- former Director General at the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure in Israel, and Vladas Lašas (also an early investor in Hyper Poland) who has co-founded Carbon War room together with Sir Richard Branson.","Hardware, Transportation",4,51-100,"Katarzyna Foljanty, Paweł Radziszewski, Przemek Paczek, Łukasz Mielczarek",10,,2022-11-02,5000000,EUR,4906950,Convertible Note,1229340,EUR,1501946,Equity Crowdfunding,2751171,USD,2751171,14730243,USD,14730243,"European Innovation Council, EIT InnoEnergy, Seedrs, MassChallenge, ValueTech Seed",3,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,5

The value proposition for Minte clients and the business case is clear - for an average insurance product (500.000 claims/year), an insurance company can save approximately 19.000 man-days. In addition, the insurer gets transparent and fast claims processing (which lowers customer churn), and data that can be used for fraud detection and product improvement.

Unclear Ownership No one clearly oversees the whole onboarding process; duties are spread out, and this dispersed responsibility is inevitable. Preboarding Communication Breakdown After a positive hiring decision, weak communication with new hires can lead to them abandoning the job before even starting. Dropping Engagement New employees quickly lose their initial high level of enthusiasm. This decline is accompanied by elevated stress levels due to a lack of a unified plan, chaotic procedures, and communication gaps. Growth Challenges Scaling the onboarding process is tough and hard to standardize.

We like to say that PressPad comes in when Adobe is too corporate and others are too complicated. Our goals are ease of use, self-service and education of publishers entering mobile markets with PressPad. We believe in mobiles and their selling potential. We also know that publishing is tough and publishers enter App Stores with little or no knowledge about mobile sales. This is why we made a commitment to educate our customers about all things mobile and to put our own revenue on the line. Over the past few months we developed a business model in which we don't make money unless our clients do.

PROBLEM Brick & mortar businesses rely on two things, returning customers and new customers. Businesses have no scalable way of knowing who their customers are and how to encourage them to return once they have left. Nor can they ask each of them to recommend them to others. SOLUTION We answer 4 key questions for business operators: Who are their customers? How happy are they? Do/will they come back? Will they recommend you? Guest WiFi is the mechanism that triggers this process and our automation tools delivery communications to drive more visits. Social WiFi sell primarily to the hospitality and retail sectors, with particular strength in hotels. Our clients do include shopping malls, offices and stadia also. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES Integrated into 95%+ of the enterprise hardware market. Setup in minutes.  SaaS model = no contracts. Easy to do business with. Offer free trial at no cost to us. Business name is industry name. Trademarked in EU. MARKET There are over 207 million open hot spots worldwide. • 30 million of those are in the retail and hospitality sectors. • 1.2 million of those are in the US only. • Each location has a potential of $4,000 yearly recurring revenue. • The market is worth $4.8bn per year. • Less than 2% of the market is covered with solutions that identify WiFi users.

Recently, the Recognize.im Team has been focusing on supporting merchandising with image recognition technology by providing a special recognition mode that enables locating products on shop shelves. The idea is to enable real-time monitoring of shelf contents with unparalleled precision, thanks to which it will be possible to obtain various kinds of reports, such as compatibility planograms or comparisons to the competition. In addition to the above, hardware support for the described algorithmic engine is being prototyped in the form of a network of simple, low-cost devices installed on premises, enabling constant monitoring of the products in stores. So far technology developed by iTraff technology has enabled the creation of many applications in the fields of e-commerce, publishing, advertising, or affiliated with major brands. Partnership projects are carried out with companies like Evernote or Facebook. The company has also collected a number of awards for its implementations, including competitions in the United States, Austria, Finland, Greece, Poland and Belgium (including the prize awarded by the European Commission Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, Neelie Kroes).","Apps, Data and Analytics, Mobile, Platforms, Software",5,11-50,"Arek Skuza, Bartlomiej Gola, Marcin Szajek, Paweł Elbanowski, Wojciech Radomski",2,Seed,2012-03-01,235000,USD,235000,Seed,235000,USD,235000,Seed,235000,USD,235000,235000,USD,235000,"SpeedUp Venture Capital Group, Innovation Nest",,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
