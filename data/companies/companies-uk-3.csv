We build member-owned and governed decentralised network platforms for the peer-to-peer exchange of tokenised value between network members. Our ethos and architecture is grounded in protocol, peer-to-peer architecture, removing friction and market inefficiencies, strong security guarantees and interoperable exchange across platforms to build a peer-to-peer ecosystem for market infrastructure. Our focus is capital markets; we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models. Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client. We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI. P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI. dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms. We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange. Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community. We also work closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and are an active member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA).","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Science and Engineering, Software",2,11-50,"Robert Sams, Vitalik Buterin",2,Early Stage Venture,2018-10-10,12000000,USD,12000000,Series A,12000000,USD,12000000,Series A,13261916,USD,13261916,13261916,USD,13261916,"Nyca Partners, XTX Markets, Route 66 Ventures",1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

With the help of e-commerce expert Rob, the pair realised that a car-sharing app (an ‘AirBnB for cars’) might offer a smarter, more environmentally friendly way for people in Britain to hire the 10 million cars rented here every year. The pair began work in August 2014, and it soon became clear that the obstacle to unlocking the value in people’s cars was simple: the keys, and the time it took to hand them over. The team worked on an app-controlled box which allowed users to unlock cars direct from the app. The QuickStart® box was born. Rob and Graeme hired their first employee in 2016, and have watched hiyacar evolve into a friendly, living community, and a company of 16 people. hiyacar still puts people first - and unlike others they were born and bred in Britain. Each hiyacar shared could take the equivalent of 11 vehicles off the road. People are getting to know their neighbours, too.

Through “Project PetaGene,” a collaboration with the Stegle Group at EMBL-EBI, they researched how to compress huge amounts of genomic data—without compromising data quality. Three years later, PetaGene is much more than a research project. They took their idea to London’s Entrepreneur First incubator and graduated with the program’s sixth cohort in 2016. That same year, they won Best of Show for their PetaSuite compression tools at Bio-IT World’s annual conference in Boston, beating out 46 competitors from 190 total exhibiting companies. Now, they’re a full-fledged company with a suite of products that do what they hoped they would when they began their research at the University of Cambridge: compress genomic data up to 6x, without affecting the quality of the data. Beyond the awards and accolades, they’re deeply committed to the motive that inspires PetaGene daily: reducing the size and associated storage cost of genomic data, so it can be more readily accessed and analyzed.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,11-50,"Dan Greenfield, Vaughan Wittorff",8,Seed,2023-05-11,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,2363046,USD,2363046,2363046,USD,2363046,"Entrepreneurs First, Acequia Capital (AceCap), Romulus Capital, Samos Investments",3,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2

Love that app and helps me fall asleep or nap on command.” -Daniel Weinard, Co-founder of Shopify Featured in The New York Times, WIRED, Engadget, Gizmodo, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and more! PRESS MENTIONS “…Hibbert credits the app for helping cure his insomnia and diminish his postgame dependence on Ambien.” – NBA Star Roy Hibbert speaking to Sports Illustrated “That night, I nestled under my covers, downloaded the full version of Pzizz and turned it on… I was out before 20 minutes had passed and haven't looked back since.” - Jenna Wortham, New York Times “Pzizz helps you get to sleep faster and get more restful sleep with a combination of soothing sounds and voice cues aimed at helping you relax, destress, and get to sleep. In my experience, it works really well.” - Adam Pash, Lifehacker HOW IT WORKS Pzizz delivers sleep at the push of a button! Using the science of psychoacoustics (see our website for in-depth details), the app's patented system plays you ""dreamscapes""— a sleep-optimized mix of music, voiceover, and sound effects that changes each night, to quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you asleep, and then wake you up feeling refreshed. If you want to sleep better at night or take incredible power naps during the day, this is the app for you! All you have to do is listen to Pzizz. Headphones/earbuds are recommended for optimal effectiveness, but your built-in phone speaker will work too. NAP MODULE Napping has been proven to enhance performance, alertness, and improve your mood. Customize your naps with our specially designed nap narrations. Get rid of that groggy feeling and improve your well-being with a 10-20 minute nap. FOCUS MODULE The focus module is music designed to help you get more work done. Built around ‘focuscapes,’ environments of sound that help you get in the zone and be productive, backed by the same thorough research we use to create our dreamscapes. Each focuscape has a ‘focus’ section which gets you into full concentration and a ‘cooldown’ section which brings you back out gently. WHAT MAKES PZIZZ SO MUCH BETTER?  *Simplicity* Sleep at the push of a button! Unlike other sleep solutions, you don’t have to change your behavior, keep a sleep diary, or limit your activities. Just listen to Pzizz, and enjoy incredible sleep.  *No Side Effects* Our only side effect is sleep! Unlike medications or supplements, you’ll never have to worry about adverse effects. *Variety* Every time you listen to Pzizz it creates a unique session for you. This ensures your brain doesn’t get fatigued from hearing the same things over and over again, and helps maintain effectiveness over time. *Highly customizable* Adjust sleep duration, volumes, 3D effect, and voice gender for a fully personalized listening experience. Also: integration with Apple Health! *Clinically Validated* Pzizz is incredibly effective and clinically validated. Read more about the science behind Pzizz at blog.pzizz.com. THE DETAILS MATTER  Our sleep researchers work closely with our audio engineers to create beautiful dreamscapes that are backed by academic psycho-acoustics, and we pair these musical dreamscapes with voice scripts based on clinical sleep interventions, and then infuse them with personalization driven through our learning algorithms so you have a different audio sequence each night (which is important to keep Pzizz effective over time). It’s wild, and incredibly potent.

Furthermore, by using audio, a proven format to aid learning, teachers and students alike can use and listen when they wish both inside and outside the classroom, on their computer or phone. Each tutorial series consists of an average of 15-30 tutorials, breaking down each core topic into a short, sharp, informative and entertaining (they love using music and sound effects to really bring them alive!) 5-10 minute podcast which provides all the details, analysis and arguments required. Education should be a joy for all. In every culture up until the 21st Century, the aural tradition has been the most powerful source of passing knowledge from generation to generation. This tradition is their inspiration at Audiopi - to capture and enable that story telling spirit that informs, teaches and entertains simultaneously. This tradition has been slowly eroded but it shouldn't have. It has stood the test of time and proves, along with many current studies, that listening and listening well, is a powerful tool for learning.  Their podcasts and their platform reflect this. They want their students to pass their exams and pass them well and they want teachers to have a resource that really aids both inside and outside the classroom. To achieve this they are creating exceptional podcasts that teach and fuel the imagination in equal measure and are building a platform so that educators and students can create, share, collaborate and learn from one another.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",1,1-10,David Piggins,3,Seed,2017-01-01,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,301815,GBP,409654,301815,GBP,409654,Creative UK,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s clear why, they provide an unrivalled opportunity for businesses across the world, big and small, to showcase their products & services and build invaluable face to face connections with their customers. However, with all the huge benefits they bring, they know that exhibiting is expensive and incredibly time consuming. As well as that, exhibition suppliers tend to only specialise in one type of product and can only deliver to certain venues or certain exhibitions at any given time. This all means that exhibitors have no choice but to use lots of different suppliers, leading to lots of lengthy paper order forms, phone calls and emails just to get everything sorted.

Sensitive data loss and leaks are problems faced by more than 78% of SMBs according to a 2014 survey. Among them, 72% shut down less than 1 year after the incident. Just one of these incidents led to $6.2M losses. The solutions currently are either insufficient of too expensive for these companies. Ukkobox (Company no. 09527513 - UK). has an easy tool that safely encrypts and spreads user files to existing cloud providers worldwide. Because they store only parts of the files on each provider with redundancy, they are secured and accessible even if some of these providers suffer an outage or are hacked.  Their unique dispersal process developed by Univ. of São Paulo (Brazil) and Univ. of Leicester (UK) represents an entry technological barrier that can be patented. If the user requires additional privacy levels, they can choose providers from states with weak international relations among themselves and distinct data privacy laws/regulations. This provides an additional geopolitical security mechanism resilient to encryption vulnerabilities, which makes unauthorized access even from governments almost impossible. They will have to cooperate with ""enemies"" countries to retrieve all data slices and also break data encryption to access user files.This technology able to scale globally along with a multi-skilled team, composed with founders with high technical security and cloud background, business knowledge, international law and creative marketing and design are the most interesting Ukkobox assets.  For the user it is straightforward. He just download and install their  app, choose the providers and countries he wishes to use for his spreading storage box, receives a temporary authentication token in his mobile and put the files inside Ukkobox folder. Their app will then encrypt, split and spread the files from the user device to storage providers directly. This ensures that they will have zero knowledge of the user stored data and access patterns. Thus ensuring full privacy for their customer's stored data. They will monetize their  solution using a SaaS model. The consumer chooses the providers (and countries) used to create his private data storage network, the storage size he need and the amount of users. From these informations, the monthly/yearly price is calculated. This model offers the reliability to use several storage providers at the same time avoiding vendor lock-in, increasing availability, privacy and security but with the convenience to manage only one account.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Privacy and Security, Software",3,1-10,"Edgard Regolão Jr, Paul Chu, Rafael Libardi",1,Seed,2016-03-07,15000,GBP,21396,Seed,15000,GBP,21396,Seed,15000,GBP,21396,15000,GBP,21396,CyLon Ventures,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

A world leading end-to-end solution, Spoon Guru combines AI and machine learning with nutritional expertise to enable food retailers to deliver a highly personalised experience tailored to each consumer, based on their distinct and unique dietary, health and wellness needs. The platform processes billions of data points on a  daily basis and analyses every ingredient as well as its nutritional value to allocate the appropriate dietary tags to each product or recipe, enabling large and unstructured data sets to be easily searched and accurately filtered to deliver relevant choices.  64% of the world’s population now actively exclude foodstuffs from their diet (Nielsen). 72% of US consumers say finding healthy food is difficult whilst a staggering 76% of consumers have unintentionally consumed food that’s restricted from their diets.  Spoon Guru enables retailers such as Tesco in the UK, Albert Heijn in the Netherlands, and Woolworths in Australia and New Zealand to cater for shoppers’ distinct and unique dietary needs – increasing the choice of foods available, whilst minimising the effort to find them.  Spoon Guru received a number of accolades including the Retail Week Customer Innovation Award for its partnership with Tesco, the Retail Technology Game Changer Award at the World Retail Awards, and the founders were presented with the Retail & E-Commerce Tech Founder of the Year at the 2018 BMW i UK Tech Founder Awards. In the US, Spoon Guru was chosen as a 2019 Red Herring Top 100 North America winner. The company was also presented the Personalized Nutrition Initiative accolade at the Nutraingredients awards, and awarded a Gold Stevie by the American Business Awards® in the category of Most Innovative Tech Company of the Year.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Food and Beverage, Hardware, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Software",3,11-50,"Markus Stripf, Simon O'Regan, Tim Allen",2,Early Stage Venture,2020-09-30,,,,Series A,,,,Series A,,,,,,,"W23, NJF Capital",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The unique CricViz computer model enables the prediction of match outcome, the interpretation of team and player performance and the anticipation of what is likely to happen next; cricket intelligence at the next level. WinViz probabilities are generated by CricViz’s unique computer model of Test cricket. This utilises a database of the last 500 Test matches played, using past and current data to estimate the probability of future events. The model uses the current state of the match, each player’s career history and characteristics of the venue and host country to simulate the remainder of the match. The simulations are run thousands of times, with the number of results that produce each match outcome converted into probabilities – if 4,000 out of 10,000 iterations result in a team winning, then that team has a 40% probability of winning. The PredictViz function outlines the most likely course the match will follow from its current position. The unique CricViz model of past and current data simulates the remainder of the game thousands of times, with the average predicted outcome for each team plotted across the game’s remaining timeline. The likeliest score and end point of each innings is predicted using the current state of the match, each player’s career history and characteristics of the venue and host country. PlayViz breaks down each team’s performance into its three basic aspects – batting, bowling and fielding. Each of those areas is given a positive or negative score in runs, measuring the performance of that team against that of an average Test team in the conditions present at that time. Team performances are compared to those of an average Test team, with adjustments taken into account for the pitch and opposition strength. The comprehensive historical database predicts the average performance of batsmen and bowlers in the position and role they are playing in. The PlayViz function measures performance relative to averages that take into account extra variables. Each team’s fielding performance is measured on the direct impact it has had on the score. Runs saved and missed are totalled for each player, with a dropped catch measured at the value of the wicket that was missed according to the model of projected scores. Fielding scores are adjusted by a system that rates the difficulty of a piece of fielding. BatViz gives a measure of how difficult batting has been in the last 30 minutes of play. It shows how hard it is for the batsmen to survive and score. The ball tracking data from every ball bowled in the match is compared to a database of over 300,000 Test deliveries. The balls in this database that are the most similar to the delivery being measured are evaluated in terms of wickets taken and runs conceded, with a game aggregate built to provide a metric of current batting difficulty at that time.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Software, Sports",2,1-10,"Nathan Leamon, Phil Oliver",1,Seed,2015-10-20,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,"Seedrs, Venrex",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
