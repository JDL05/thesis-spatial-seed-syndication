Founded in 2018 as a spin-out company from the University of Oxford, the world’s #1 research university, Caristo has developed a portfolio of imaging-based and AI-assisted platforms that can be applied to aid the prediction and diagnosis of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Caristo was highlighted by Nature in 2020 as one of the most exciting science-based companies to have emerged from academic labs. To-date Caristo has attracted over £23 million in venture capital investment (nearly US$30 million).    Named first of “7 Technologies That Could Change Heart Healthcare Forevermore” by the Robb Report, the CaRi-Heart technology is Caristo’s flagship offering which aids coronary artery disease diagnosis with improved risk prediction. It applies advanced AI algorithms to routine cardiac CT scans to visualize and quantify coronary inflammation, which is the previously invisible root cause of the disease. Each patient’s CaRi-Heart Report includes several clinical results: (1) the patient specific Fat Attenuation Index (FAI), a novel and patented biomarker for the measurement of coronary inflammation, which indicates the patient’s risk in % relative to a matched peer group; (2) CaRi-Heart Risk, which assesses the absolute 8-year risk of a fatal heart attack (based on both coronary inflammation status and standard clinical risks factors); and (3) coronary plaque-specific characterization and quantification. The CaRi-Heart Analysis is supported by the CaRi-Heart software, which is cloud-based and agnostic to the type of scanner generating the routine cardiac CT images. The CaRi-Heart technology is CE Mark certified under the latest EU MDR with UKCA marking being received in September 2022. CaRi-Heart is limited to research use in the U.S. before the FDA grants marketing authorization.  Multiple patents underpinning CaRi-Heart technologies have been granted in major jurisdictions around the world. In addition, exceptional validation results showing Cari-Heart’s ability to aid the prediction of heart attacks have been published in leading medical journals including the Lancet, JACC, European Heart Journal, and Cardiovascular Research. CaRi-Heart validation and implementation projects have been supported by multiple UK government grants and awards, including the NHS AI Stage 3 Award for real-world evaluation and implementation of CaRi-Heart care pathway in multiple NHS hospitals. With its deep clinical insights, proven validity and implementation readiness, the CaRi-Heart Analysis Service and the resulting new care pathway can transform cardiac care around the world by aiding in better prediction and prevention of future heart attacks.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",4,11-50,"Charalambos Antoniades, Cheerag Shirodaria, Keith Channon, Stefan Neubauer",4,,2024-09-30,150000,USD,150000,Venture - Series Unknown,150000,USD,150000,Venture - Series Unknown,30064338,USD,30064338,30064338,USD,30064338,"Oxford Science Enterprises, Longwall Venture, BGF Ventures, Oxford University Innovation, HeartX",5,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

GRACE has been designed alongside some of the leading neurosurgeons in the UK, with the aim of extending patient life expectancy without impacting patient quality of life. For patients with the most common primary brain tumour, glioblastoma, there has been a severe lack of new, effective treatments for decades, with only a handful of approved options. Because of this, glioblastoma has some of the worst outcomes of any cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of <5.  Co-founder and academic neurosurgeon Dr Richard Fu recognised this and was frustrated not only by the lack of treatments available for patients but also by major design flaws in newer electric field therapy approaches. Working together with Dr Chris Bullock, a biomedical engineer who had been carrying out research at Manchester's world-class materials research centres, they formed an elegant solution designed to optimise patient life-expectancy and quality of life.  QV Bioelectronics was founded to their solution GRACE, to patients. Since then, their ground-breaking materials science research has received nearly $1M in financial awards from several UK institutions, including Innovate UK and the National Institute for Health Research in the UK, as well as over $1M in equity funding from international life science seed investors SOSV, and renowned life-science investors in Consilience & Catapult Ventures.

We’re all dog-parents here at WufWuf, so we know the struggle ALL too well.  Most think the solution is to give them stimulating toys, treats, and chews that will keep them busy while we’re away--right?  The trouble is the time and effort it takes to research - and then go find - toys and chews that are SAFE and HEALTHY… Not to mention the strain it puts on our wallets, especially if your dog is particularly… enthusiastic about toys.  We decided we needed an easier way to keep our dogs happy.  WufWuf was founded not only to make it EFFORTLESS for you to provide the best products for your dog, but also to make it easier to afford. This makes it simpler than ever to provide consistent stimulation to your furry family member – resulting in a healthier happier dog.
