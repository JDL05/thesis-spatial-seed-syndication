It uses a unique person-to-person online marketplace to facilitate currency exchange between users, in a simple and anonymous fashion. CurrencyFair's customers can exchange currency using a three step process.   1) Funds in the currency to be sold are sent by the customer to the corresponding CurrencyFair bank account.  When received by CurrencyFair, they are credited to the users individual CurrencyFair account and made available for exchanging. 2) Available funds in a users account can at any time be exchanged by the user into another currency using the corresponding marketplace (for example GBP to EUR). 3) Funds received from marketplace exchanges are available to be sent out to a bank account as instructed online by the customer. Each currency exchange marketplace (for example GBP to EUR) gives the customer a choice: exchange immediately at the best rate available (usually no worse than 0.5% from the interbank rate, and sometimes better than the interbank rate), or place an order at a better exchange rate and wait to be matched off by another customer exchanging on the opposite market (for example EUR to GBP).  Funds that are placed unmatched on the marketplace are aggregated by rate, and may be matched in part or in full at any time.  Unmatched orders can be cancelled or amended at any time.  All exchanges are anonymous - the customer only deals with CurrencyFair. CurrencyFair is regulated by the Irish Financial Regulator as an Authorised Payments Institution under the European Payment Services Regulations 2009.  Authorised Payment Institutions (as opposed to Small Payments Institutions) are required to provide safeguards around client funds during the exchange and transfer process.  CurrencyFair maintains segregated client accounts, and client funds are never commingled with CurrencyFair's own money.  This means that in the unlikely event of CurrencyFair encountering difficulties in operation, all client funds remain ring-fenced and would be returned to customers, not used to settle CurrencyFair's obligations.","Financial Services, Payments",4,51-100,"Brett Meyers, David Christian, Jonathan Potter, Sean Barrett",10,,2018-08-21,,,,Debt Financing,8000000,EUR,8946955,Venture - Series Unknown,24490494,USD,24490494,24490494,USD,24490494,"Octopus Ventures, Enterprise Ireland, Claret Capital Partners, Frontline Ventures, Channel 4 Ventures",3,6,2,Made Acquisitions,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,1

SensiPass offers 3-factor authentication in 3 seconds for the highest level of identity assurance for desktop, mobile or physical access.  We simply make biometrics smarter. Virtual (AR/VR/MR/XR) environments provide detailed information beneficial to users in many industrial and critical environments.  Identity assurance of the individual accessing these data, and inputting interactive and other sensor data is critical to both the training of that individual and during use in the field.

The method involves the user registering a virtual object and/or biometric, as well as a secret interaction with that registered object/token.  The process can take place completely within the immersive environment or by incorporating a mobile device for data capture and measuring interactions, depending on the specific use case.

Each member of the group adds a set amount of money to a group betting fund. Then each week a different member of the team becomes the fund manager. The fund manager gathers betting suggestions from the team members, through the team wall where all of the users can socialise and discuss their tips and how their previous bets performed. The fund manager can then choose their favourites and bet a portion of the fund on these and everyone can watch how they perform. The betting is a simple process within the BragBet application which will be fulfilled through our partner, Boylesports.  A leader board will show which teams perform best and also provide statistics about the best fund managers and tipsters.

As frustrating as it may for you, the user, the lack of a good product search tool is a common problem for marketing professionals at B2B companies costing their employers leads, revenues and clients.  This is the problem that we help marketing professionals at B2B organizations solve in a simple and scalable manner. We solve the problem by using the semantic web, facet search and dynamic product categories to create an easy way for users to discover a product quickly on corporate websites, smart phones and tablets.  Our platform is simple to use because we provide a web based online platform that enables non technical marketing and media agency professionals to easily implement this solution without any coding. We have made the solution very scalable by deploying a single multi-tenant semantic web triple store database (NoSQL) in the cloud to support thousands of clients and thousands of data structures simultaneously. In addition we have architected the platform so that multiple partner companies can contribute content  thereby creating a networking of partners’ products that are connected across Apps and their respective corporate websites.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Mobile, Software",2,1-10,"Desmond Byrne, Ken Corcoran",3,,2015-05-29,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,,,,"SOSV, Selr8r",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
