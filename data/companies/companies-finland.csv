Design can be done in-browser with intuitive drag-and-drop tools. After all, humans judge design with their eyes, therefore it seems just normal to see right away how designs will look across all different devices and platforms. FROONT's new tool might be seen as a thread to front-end developers and it is. They are giving more power into the hands of designers, as responsive web design first of all is about the design. They are removing the need of a developer at the design stage and fixing cross-browser compatibility issues, so the developers can focus on things that actually matter. Using FROONT will be possible via an invitation from a friend. However to celebrate their launch for a limited time everyone is invited to sign up. Projects created with FROONT will be free if you keep your work public. There will be a subscription fee introduced later for creating private projects. This model has worked really well for Github, Prezi and others. FROONT is founded by three work-friends – a Designer who is also CEO, a coder and a marketing professional. Previously they worked in advertising, founded their own design studio and, as a side project, made a simple content management system called www.berta.me. Berta is operational and generating profits. The reason behind FROONT is that they think the web design process needs to be improved dramatically. Currently they are a team of 6 and are based across San Francisco, Helsinki and Riga.
