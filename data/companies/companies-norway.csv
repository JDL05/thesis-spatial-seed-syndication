PortalOne's business model is centered around the concept of 'hybrid games', a novel category that combines elements of traditional gaming with interactive TV shows. Currently accessible only via mobile devices, the company hosts daily 24-hour tournaments every day where players can compete in a variety of games across different genres, including Atari games, for which the company has the exclusive global distribution rights for many of its titles like 'Pong', 'Breakout' and 'Centipede'. These games are not just standalone experiences, but are integrated with TV shows broadcasted within the games themselves. Players play throughout the day with the goal of climbing the Leaderboards for each game, with the opportunity to win real prizes such as cash and holidays. PortalOne's first show format, the 'Arcade Show' -- the TV component of hybrid games -- is hosted every single day in the PortalOne app. The show sees special guests come into the PortalOne universe and become immersed inside the game worlds as real characters. They play a round of a PortalOne game, and then players play against them on their mobile device at home. Previous guests on the Arcade Show include Justin Bieber, Demi Lovato, Tori Kelly, and Atari founder Nolan Bushnell.  The company has been operational since 2018 and has been steadfast in its mission to merge the best aspects of the gaming and TV industries. PortalOne's vision is to be the ultimate destination for hybrid games, in the same way that Spotify is for music and podcasts, and Netflix is for TV and film. PortalOne will host hundreds of games across all genres on its platform, with multiple show formats in its universe. The company also intends to become cross-platform.

Each year approximately 800.000 patients die of their CRC. The gold standard for diagnosis of CRC is colonoscopy, targeting polyps, abnormal tissue growths that may evolve into cancer. Early disease detection has a significant impact on mortality from colorectal cancer, going from a high 5-year survival probability of 90% if detected early, to a low 10-30% 5-year survival probability in later stages. Studies have shown that up to 40% of polyps can be missed during colonoscopies. Large variations in detection rates are also observed between physicians.  To remedy the variability in detection rates, there is a high medical need for tools to improve detection of polyps in colonoscopy. Such tools can save lives and reduce the treatment costs for hospitals and society by preventing CRC cases due to early detection. Based on more than 10 years of research conducted at Simula Research Laboratory, we are developing, documenting and commercializing an AI-powered digital health system that can detect polyps in real-time during a colonoscopy examination without interruption of the procedure. The device is connected to the video output of standard endoscopy equipment and provides feedback on visible lesions to the performing doctor overlaid on their examination screen. Augere's vision is to harness the currently untapped potential of endoscopic video and augment the information by analyzing it using Augere's best-in-class technology. This opens a whole new range of valuable services of patient-adapted healthcare that has the potential to transform the field of endoscopy.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Hardware, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Software",,1-10,,2,,2024-11-19,23000000,NOK,2098520,Undisclosed,23000000,NOK,2098520,Undisclosed,23000000,NOK,2098520,23000000,NOK,2098520,Farvatn Venture,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

We achieve this through cross-border credit scoring, fair risk profiles, and a portable financial history that moves from country to country with you.  Historically, people have been excluded from financial services because of, let's say, poverty. While you don’t have a proper risk profile, you fall prey to payday lenders. Now you are trapped. Others have chosen to exclude themselves from traditional financial services. What that means? They make lifestyle decisions to become nomadic in the way they live, work, and earn money. The challenge that entrepreneurs and nomads have is that they can't get an affordable rental apartment, or a mobile phone, or a credit card in their new home. Why? For people with both these profiles, either their credit history is not portable or a standard risk profile simply doesn't suit them. So at goscore we built a cross-border credit scoring solution that is fair and human-centric. We bring your financial history with you wherever you go.  Goscore also enables lenders to accurately assess your creditworthiness based on up-to-date information from various data sources. goscore brings your credit history to you, without borders. So, whoever was previously excluded, is now included. Using machine learning, our solution leverages up-to-date transactional data and derives relevant financial insights to build real-time comprehensive financial profiles. In turn, these profiles enable our customers to make sustainable lending decisions. Our technology recently helped a lender to increase creditworthy borrowers by 21% and reduce default rates by 32%.
