Where humans no longer need mouse movements and keyboard presses to figure out how to use software because you now have a computer that will do what you tell it to do.  Agile Loop’s AL OS1 is making that a reality now.  We’re an Artificial General Intelligence venture building a self-learning foundation model for Actionable AI Agents trained to act skilfully in the digital world. Our foundation model can operate any software user interface it sees with just human language prompts. It has an infinite context window, continually learns in production and therefore evolves and develops new capabilities based on your specific needs at run time. Foundation Model APIs (Third Party Integrations): 1)   For Developers | Access our foundation model APIs to fine-tune and deploy a custom AI Agent trained to execute your choice of tasks and on your choice of Software/OS.  2)  For Software Companies | Integrate our Model APIs to build a Co-pilot for your SaaS product and transform your user interface into a human language driven interface. Your users can simply prompt the AI to execute their tasks on your SaaS product. This way they won’t find difficulty in using your product’s interface and you won’t worry about losing users due to a complex UI.  Search Action Engine (SaaS Subscription):       A subscription-based AI agent trained to use browsers on your behalf and handle your web-based tasks. It allows users to operate all kinds of web apps through one chat interface. Talk to your browser and tell it to book flights and hotels online, do e-commerce activities such as online shopping on eBay, and much more. It surfs through the web in seconds, summarises results based on your prompt, and navigates the browser to complete your task.

Millions of new books, songs, and visual works are produced each year, but most are never seen by audiences. The industry’s marketing approach hasn’t evolved to match the scale of skyrocketing output and marketing teams simply can't keep up. As a result, 70–90% of signed creatives get zero marketing support, talent stays invisible and IP is not monetised. It’s more than a pain point, it’s a structural flaw that put the industry’s entire business model of developing talent pipelines and commercialising creative work at risk. Showcase is building a new marketing infrastructure that will transform how media promotes its products and talent. Our approach is decentralised, AI-powered, collaborative, and creator-led. We turn the industry’s rosters into its most powerful growth marketing engine by empowering talent to market talent and reach vast new audiences. We use AI to generate rich profiles of every creative on the platform, then match them for high-potential collaborations, equip them with new workflows and tools to launch campaigns, and measure performance to optimise results. Publishing is our wedge vertical, where we're already helping publishers match books to influencers and creatives across social platforms. But Showcase is built to scale horizontally across media categories with a repeatable GTM strategy. What we’re building comes at a crucial time, as Gen-AI content starts flooding consumers, making visibility even harder for human creatives and their products. Showcase will give media and creative industries a scalable, inclusive way to grow audiences and IP value in an era of infinite content.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Science and Engineering, Software",3,1-10,"Bastien Guerre, Benjamin Santucci, Maxence Brochard",1,Seed,2023-04-03,150000,EUR,163602,Pre-Seed,150000,EUR,163602,Pre-Seed,150000,EUR,163602,150000,EUR,163602,Antler,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
