The patient can follow her results as well as her progress in the application and unlock new universes according to the points obtained. Much of the effort of Fizimed's technical teams is focused on balancing a product, combining the quality and safety of a medical device, with a fun application to empower each woman.

Ecov accompanies businesses and communities in achieving carpool solutions. 80% of trips in France are made by private car. This has huge environmental and economic consequences – in France private cars account for 16% of greenhouse gas emissions and eat up 14% of the average household budget. Reliance on cars is also a major social concern, with 54% of people living on a low income having to turn down work due to lack of transport. Moreover, on a day-to-day basis, the average car carries just 1.3 people, meaning that the road transport system (roads + vehicles + users + networks) is not being used efficiently. Carpooling (sometimes also referred to as lift-sharing, car-sharing or ride-sharing) is one solution. However, although carpooling is now a popular choice for long journeys, only 3% of day-to-day trips are made using conventional, pre-booked carpooling services. We believe we can change this. To change behaviours and reduce the number of solo drivers on the roads, we need to re-think how carpooling works. The constraints inherent in pre-booked carpooling are a barrier to uptake. That’s where our new concept – the carpooling line – comes in.

Today, the market lacks transparency and trust, which leaves 50% of homeowners dissatisfied with the result and the cost. Although renovations often represent a significant financial cost, homeowners are left in the dark in terms of budgeting, timing and quality. Only in France, the renovation market is worth €40B, but it is hugely fragmented with many small players being unable to negotiate discounts with their providers. Hemea tackles this market through its SaaS enabled platform, which connects homeowners wishing to renovate their homes, with carefully selected architects and qualified local contractors. The company has a winning strategy due to its customer oriented focus, where respect for the budget and the timing, as well as transparency in prices are at the core of the business. On top of this, the company generates immense value for contractors, as the service delivers high demand and seamless administrative tools, streamlining their work.","Commerce and Shopping, Real Estate, Software",3,11-50,"Arnaud Kleinpeter, Matthieu Burin, Yann Depoys",4,,2023-01-25,10000000,EUR,10920500,Venture - Series Unknown,10000000,EUR,10920500,Venture - Series Unknown,16860000,EUR,18375636,16860000,EUR,18375636,"Bpifrance, Daphni, BREEGA, LBO France, WILCO",2,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Klassroom caters specifically to educator needs while offering the level of engagement and ease-of-use found in the most widely used online social platforms. When a teacher starts to use the app in one classroom, other teachers in the school join in very quickly and easily. Teachers can create a new class in just minutes, and they invite parents to access posts in the class feed including announcements, homework, videos, pictures of activities, polls, events, documents, and more. Klassroom’s level of parent engagement is outstanding: more than 90% are monthly active users. Parents can react to posts, contact the teacher for appointments, or initiate private conversations using tools that are designed to strengthen parent-teacher relationships while protecting the teacher’s time. Klassroom can translate all posts and private messages between parent and teacher into 100 different languages, and Klassroom can also accommodate the visually impaired. Every parent or guardian can be involved — even across multiple households. Klassroom co-founders Frank-David Cohen and Damien Rottemberg have been friends since childhood and planned that one day they would build something together to make a positive difference in the world. That opportunity came in 2016 when both were divorced dads who found themselves distanced from the education of their children and wanting to be better connected. In Paris and New York respectively, Frank-David and Damien provided the first Klassroom app prototype to the teachers of their young children. The result was the same on both sides of the Atlantic: enthusiastic adoption by the teacher and a 95% parent view rate of all classroom communication. By listening closely to teachers’ needs, Klassroom has maintained a nearly perfect satisfaction rating.

Jooxter was developed at Euratechnologies, the heart of innovation in the Hauts-de-France region. As Director of Workplace Technologies at GWS Global Workplace Solutions (Johnson Controls), Fabien noticed a general irrelevance with existing solutions on the market. They required heavy maintainance, were intrusive (often required wiring and on-prem servers), and were completely isolated reflecting an inability to interact with the connected environment of the building, the essential requirement of a Building Operating System (BOS). Moreover, today everyone talks about reducing building energy expenditure when it only represents 1% of business expenses! But what about office occupancy? Rental expenses are the biggest business expense after salaries. This is how the Jooxter solution was born and became a pioneer in Smart Occupancy. Today, Jooxter has become a reference in the Proptech domain and is growing exponentially. Fabien brought together an amazing team was built, combining experience and youth to make the most out of technology. As a responsible and innovative company with solid foundations, Jooxter's mission is to make the buildings of every organisation 100% responsible, and subsequently 100% occupied.

Keecker is the first robot that provides entertainment, security, communication and smart data for the entire home at once. A large screen, great sound, a camera, a powerful computer and environmental sensors, not in one particular location but in all rooms as it moves autonomously throughout the home. Inside the robot is an Android-based computer on which any Google Play store app can be downloaded. It contains a smart video projector that can be oriented at 90° to have a screen on a wall, a door or a ceiling. Its sound system is second to none, providing a great surround sound wherever it is. Its camera, great for group chats, captures at 360° all around it and displays everything it sees and everyone around it at once. Keecker also captures and analyses home essential information (temperature, humidity, CO2, light, noise levels) to take the pulse of homes and alert users in real time in case of unusual events. Finally Keecker maps homes and continuously learns about its environment, people and usage patterns. Users can call it to come to them, follow them or go check in particular rooms.   Keecker provides these possibilities to every room. So you can watch Netflix, cinema size, in your bed, get the kids to play in their room, Skype with friends while cooking, freely, cable-free, simply and intuitively. Even while away from home, the Keecker smartphone application lets you check in, move around remotely see anywhere at home, chat and be seen: as close as it gets to teleportation.    Their principles: open (through Android and their open SDK), smart (through machine learning and AI), safe (through secure and user centric encryption).

The company specializes in high-quality 3D face analysis and synthesis for which there is growing demand and increasingly varied potential for applications. With regard to analysis, for example, there are still few available solutions which are capable of performing subtle detection of facial features in real-time. And yet the needs in this field are growing as can be seen in the increasing use of reality applications at points of sale – virtual trying-on of glasses and virtual make-up are some examples – and in the marketing field’s requirements for detecting individuals’ gender and/or age. There are also significant needs for synthesis due to the increasing accessibility of video games and the development of serious gaming, etc. However, there are still currently very few solutions for producing truly realistic facial animations – in most cases developing such animation quickly becomes costly and, depending on the application, the solutions offered are not always suitable. While more and more virtual humans are appearing on our screens, the current content creation solutions are not sufficient to meet the increasing level of realism demanded. There is an immediate need to develop statistical systems which can produce good quality, on-the-fly animations. With a view to meeting these needs, right from being founded Dynamixyz employed a large research team (six PhD holders specialised in the analysis/synthesis fields). The company aims to create high-tech products, for professional users, which can be easily-integrated into any platform.","Consumer Electronics, Gaming, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Video",3,11-50,"Gaspard Breton, Olivier Aubault, Renaud Seguier",1,M&A,2014-03-10,450000,EUR,624448,Seed,450000,EUR,624448,Seed,450000,EUR,624448,450000,EUR,624448,"Kima Ventures, Nestadio Capital, Entrepreneurs Partners",,3,,Was Acquired,Dynamixyz acquired by Take-Two Interactive Software,https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/take-two-interactive-software-acquires-dynamixyz--da4e9c54,Take-Two Interactive Software,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/take-two-interactive-software,2021-07-01,day,,,,Acquisition,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2
