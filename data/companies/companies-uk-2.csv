Rainbird lets you build visual models of your smartest employees’ thought processes, then uses these models to automate decision making at rates typically 100x faster and 25% more accurate, with full explainability. Rainbird prevents billions being lost due to inconsistent, uninformed decision making. How does Rainbird automate complex decisions? 1. Capture expertise without coding Using a visual modeller, create knowledge maps of the thought processes applied by subject matter experts in any field. Knowledge maps aren’t linear (like decision trees in robotic process automation) or opaque (like machine learning models). This means you can productise expertise and make it available at scale. 2. Ask complex questions Pose questions or scenarios to Rainbird that align with the area of knowledge covered by your map. You can do this using conversational interfaces, APIs or other systems. Rainbird will provide answers with varying levels of certainty, even when dealing with ambiguity or incomplete data. This improves the accuracy of nuanced, multidimensional analyses, like fraud detection. 3. Get explanations for answers Ask Rainbird why it’s given you a particular answer and it will show an evidence tree of its reasoning, including all considered variables and the quantitative impact of each. This ensures you can comply with regulations and enjoy the full confidence of customers.

Exonate’s lead programme is focused on Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO). A consequence of diabetic retinopathy, DMO, is swelling in an area of the retina called the macula and wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wAMD), which is the leading cause of vision loss in people aged 60 and older.  The Company is founded on scientific excellence with strong links to Professor David Bates and his lab at Nottingham University specializing in the biology and biochemical pathways of VEGF splice variants. Exonate have developed small molecules that inhibit production of pro-angiogenic VEGF through selective inhibition of serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated VEGF splicing.  These inhibitors have already demonstrated superior efficacy as topical agents in preclinical models of wet AMD.  Through a Wellcome Trust funded project, Exonate has completed an optimization programme and has nominated a pre-clinical candidate drug with optimal characteristics. During the second quarter of 2020 regulatory toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have taken place. This is to support the successful application to the regulatory authorities for clinical evaluation.   Exonate is led by an experienced, international management team that has previously worked together with cross-disciplinary experience in medicine and drug development, as well as successful fundraising for early stage companies. About Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO)*: DMO is the build-up of fluid (Oedema) in a region of the retina called the macula. The macula is important for the sharp, straight-ahead vision that is used for reading, recognizing faces, and driving. DMO is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetic retinopathy. About half of all people with diabetic retinopathy will develop DMO and although it is more likely to occur as diabetic retinopathy worsens, DMO can happen at any stage of the disease. About wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD): Today, wet AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in people aged 60 years or older and affects more than 30 million patients worldwide, over 200,000 of those in the UK alone. If untreated patients are likely to lose sight in the affected eye within 24 months of disease onset. The main currently available treatment options for DMO and wet AMD are: •	anti-VEGF antibody drugs – to prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. Unlike small molecule drugs or eye drops these treatments must be injected into the eye once every 1 or 2 months. Resistance can develop to these drugs causing the disease to progress anew. •	Laser surgery – to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the eye. This type of surgery is only suitable if blood vessel damage is not too extensive and if the abnormal blood vessels aren't close to the fovea, as performing surgery close to this part of the eye can cause permanent vision loss. •	With DMO, Corticosteroids either injected or implanted into the eye, may be used alone or in combination with other drugs or laser surgery to treat DMO. *source: https://nei.nih.gov/health/diabetic/retinopathy","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",4,11-50,"Catherine Beech, David Bates, Lucy Donaldson, Stephen Harper",6,Early Stage Venture,2019-01-03,1500000,GBP,1894181,Series A,1500000,GBP,1894181,Series A,4200000,GBP,5620973,9100000,GBP,11730295,"Parkwalk Advisors, Wellcome Trust, ACF Investors, Martlet Capital, Uniseed",2,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Once damage is detected, it is usually permanent and therefore it is vital to make the diagnosis as soon as possible to commence treatment. The ROS product is based on patented technology covering the use of visual field testing using a cursor and LED screen: the product is currently configured for use within a Windows environment and has two developed tests in play; the Full Threshold Test and the Suprathreshold Test.

Capacitance is the ability of a system to store electrical charge. CTS uses aluminium or copper in a series of layers formed into two interlocking continuous electrodes.  The layers are separated using a dielectric material, typically polyester or polypropylene.  When connected to a power source, a charge is distributed along the upstream electrode which then transfers a charge to the downstream electrode by capacitive coupling.  Unlike a conventional cable, there is no direct conductive connection between source and load.  The CTS can be designed to have a specific capacitance value, which allows it to overcome the inductance problem inherent in all existing cables and also to contribute extra capacitance by design, benefiting the whole electrical system.","Energy, Manufacturing, Other",2,11-50,"Dominic Quennell, Gareth O Brien",8,Early Stage Venture,2020-05-18,5000000,USD,5000000,Series A,5000000,USD,5000000,Series A,8081410,USD,8081410,8163278,USD,8163278,"EASME, Tangram Partners Limited, Adelpha",1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Neil started Zeal Innovation Ltd at the end of 2013, with marketer Will Riley, whom he met at Southampton University many years before, to develop and commercialise Litelok. In March 2015 a successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter raised more than £232,000 for the Litelok concept, helping turn the idea into a reality.  Today, Liteloks are used and trusted by a multitude of bike owners across the world. **Litelok Features** Light - Weighing just 1.1 Kg, Litelok is much lighter than comparable Gold rated flexible bike locks. Flexible - There’s nothing on the market that offers the flexibility and security of Litelok. Its flexibility means you can secure your bike to more fixed objects than traditional D-locks. Strong - Made with a patented composite strap that's difficult to break. Litelok is independently tested, achieving the highest security rating: Sold Secure Gold. Click to lock - Litelok has been designed to easily click closed without the need for a key, making it faster to lock your bike up. A key is only used to unlock your bicycle. Easy to carry - Liteloks come with velcro WrapStraps which let you securely attach your Litelok along your top tube or within your bike frame. Liteloks can also be carried in your bag. Twin Liteloks - Our innovative in-line lock allows us to offer Litelok in twin-lock format - i.e. a pack of two Liteloks which operate from the same unique key. Use the two bike locks separately for extra security, or joined together for extra length. **Building Better Security for Bicycles** The strap component of Litelok is made of a patented composite called Boaflexicore. It harnesses the unique security properties of multiple innovative, lightweight materials. Each layer provides additional security, meaning it can withstand sustained attack to the highest level. The in-line lock has been developed with a well-known UK lock manufacturer and has been tested and trialled to ensure it is the most reliable and secure lock possible. **Independently Tested** Litelok has achieved the highest security rating of Gold from Sold Secure and is the lightest, flexible bike lock to have achieved that rating.  Sold Secure is the premier independent testing and certification house for security products in the UK. Established in 1992 by the Northumbria and Essex Police with the help and backing of the Home Office. Sold Secure is now owned and administered by the Master Locksmiths Association (a not for profit trade association). They have close ties with many police forces and insurers in the UK, who provide Sold Secure with regular information on modern theft methods and the tools used by criminals. It has a three tier security grading system, of which Gold is the best, followed by Silver and then Bronze. Gold rated locks offer the highest level of security. Silver rated locks offer a compromise between cost and security. Bronze rated locks typically offers defence against the opportunistic thief.",Manufacturing,1,11-50,Neil Barron,2,,2021-03-17,25000,GBP,34939,Equity Crowdfunding,25000,GBP,34939,Equity Crowdfunding,25000,GBP,34939,25000,GBP,34939,"Development Bank of Wales, Venrex",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Their KYnergy technology uses the textile Celliant to recycle the body's waste energy back for the benefit of the wearer, to enhance performance and accelerate recovery processes. They designed and engineered their specialist sportswear to work harder for you, so you can perform at your MAXIMUM potential. KYMIRA Sport products have been designed specifically with the purpose of enhancing performance and accelerating recovery. With their inbuilt KYnergy infrared technology embedded within the fibres of their fabrics, your body gains from the following responses that occur when you are exposed to infrared. click on the PROVEN benefits below to find out exactly how the magic happens! Using their KYnergy infrared technology causes an increase in a molecule called Nitric Oxide (NO) which is a vasodilator. This means that NO causes your blood vessels to expand, allowing more blood to pass through them  Putting it simply, using their KYnergy infrared technology means that your muscles have more fuel available and work more efficiently. Breaking this down, because your circulation is increased, more oxygen is delivered to the muscle cells (more fuel).   There isn't a simple way to explain this, but in short: when you use KYMIRA kit, the infrared causes NO to dissociate from the active site of one of the enzyme Cytochrome-C Oxidase which is part of the energy production process within your cells. Because the active site is free, the metabolic processes within your cells occur quicker resulting in a number of further responses: increased energy (ATP) production and cells grow, repair & replicate quicker. Finally studies have found that using their technology will alleviate pain because as well as acting as a vasodilator, NO also reacts with a molecule called cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) which then mediates a pain relief response. The NO & cGMP reaction is actually the same way that taking an opiate like morphine works, but infrared is a lot less potent.","Biotechnology, Consumer Goods, Science and Engineering, Sports",1,11-50,Timothy Brownstone,3,Seed,2019-04-19,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,394657,GBP,539780,394657,GBP,539780,"K50 Ventures, Henley Business Angels",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,3

Problem: Delayed intervention, suboptimal healthcare, lack of trusted information, and adverse lifestyle factors are key reasons why patients have ongoing musculoskeletal conditions (e.g. neck and low back pain) and develop chronic diseases. 83% of health insurer outgoings are spent on claims, making them reliant on customers achieving timely recovery from ill health and maintenance of good health in order to remain financially viable. The insurer currently has limited ability to influence this as they are disconnected from their customers. Solution: TrackActive will provide an exercise rehabilitation, early intervention, and prevention application, incorporating wearable technology and behavioural science, to address the needs of customers with, or at risk of, musculoskeletal conditions and chronic diseases. This will decrease reliance on health providers and reduce claims costs. It will compliment the existing TrackActive rehabilitation platform to be a complete self management solution for the customer. TrackActive may also improve satisfaction and retention of customers with their insurer. Traction: The TrackActive rehabilitation platform was developed and launched in March 2015. An Australian Government grant, 26 000 patients across 11 countries, 70 data parameters, a content licencing partnership with Johnson & Johnson, and early relationships with insurers highlights the ability of TrackActive to deliver effective digital healthcare solutions. Competitive Advantage: TrackActive has acquired unique knowledge through extensive exercise research reviews and intelligence from two years of data collection to expand its offering to ‘self service’ early intervention and prevention solutions for insurance customers. Additionally, as rehabilitation can act as a trigger to lifestyle change and ongoing wellness in patients, TrackActive is well positioned to own this customer experience due to the traction achieved with its existing rehabilitation platform. Revenue Model: TrackActive will charge a fee to insurers based on the number of active customers using the application and access levels to data insights. TrackActive also currently receives subscription revenue from health clinics using the rehabilitation platform, as well as content licencing fees with third party, non-competing organisations.",Health Care,2,1-10,"Ian Prangley, Michael Levens",4,Seed,2019-02-14,300000,GBP,383939,Seed,300000,GBP,383939,Seed,400302,USD,400302,400302,USD,400302,"Startupbootcamp, DigitalHealth.London Accelerator, Reece Chowdhry, Startupbootcamp InsurTech London, HR TECH Partnership",2,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,3

Customers can also see their designs on models before sending to knit with Unmade’s unique preview technology. No-one else has been able to offer custom production in knitwear due to the high programming cost. Unmade’s patent-pending technologies remove this cost and makes one-off production possible at a similar cost to local mass production.   Through Unmade, brands can then offer bespoke, customised or limited edition knitwear to their customers. Using the same machines as major brands such as Burberry or Benetton, Unmade is running factory trials early next year to prove their technologies at an industrial scale.

The current state of regulations across every country is based upon paper-based documents, which are interpreted by each public and private organization, resulting with high administration costs, whilst cultivating many types of risks because of the variety of interpretations. An Australian in-depth study (Unleashing Productivity), by Deloitte, estimated that it costs AUD 94bn to administer and comply with Australian federal, state, and local government rules. This equates to circa 6% of Australia’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The equivalent annual cost of regulation to the UK economy is GDP 170bn, for the USA economy the cost is USD 1,286bn, and for the world economy the cost is USD 5,236bn.   After extensive research and development, we can now digitise rule-based knowledge such as regulations and procedures. Our approach from the outset, has been to develop a universal and unifying language with embedded methods to transcend from the monologue to the dialogue of rule-based knowledge traditionally found in paper-based documents or equivalent. This quest has been about the shift of treating rule-based knowledge as an intangible to a tangible, working and measurable asset. Our journey has transversed across public and private sectors to ensure our approach was universal in the way it could codify increasing complexity, whilst masking this complexity from the human interaction. Just as importantly, we have automatically generated an audit trail of the human interaction for safeguarding people and organisations. The biggest value comes from the standardisation of dialogue-data, which enables continuous intelligence, benchmarks, patterns and predictions to be delivered in an accurate and timely manner for learnings at the edge.  Our technology covers: RegTech, White-box Algorithms, Dialogue-Step Orchestration (contextual data input, image, picture, pickup codes, adaptive cars); Digital Agents (stateless software services similar in concept to Agent-Based Models), Azure Cloud, SaaS, new form of Big Data (one dimensional dialogue-strings), Compliance Automation, Analytics, APIs, Progressive Web Apps,  access from multiple channels, and AI/ML.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",2,1-10,"Freddie McMahon, John Rawlings",2,Seed,2016-04-30,250000,GBP,365269,Seed,250000,GBP,365269,Seed,365000,GBP,557831,365000,GBP,557831,ESRG Investments,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

It will allow food delivery businesses to borrow and lend drivers from one another at short notice. In addition, GPS tracking will provide full visibility of all orders.  One member generates revenue from otherwise redundant resource while the other is able to keep their customer satisfied. Food delivery businesses can't always predict when there will be a surge in the number of orders received and as such struggle to meet customer expectations with timely deliveries. One of the key contributors to this is the limited access to delivery drivers. Further, the majority don't have access to an affordable solution to track their drivers which then makes the dispatch process inefficient. The Delivery Club technology platform is being designed to tackle both of these challenges, providing a holistic solution. With the comfort that they can access drivers when needed, we believe these businesses would be more inclined to increase their marketing spend and grow their businesses. Further, they would have the ability to earn money towards the cost of their delivery drivers when they would otherwise be idle. The GPS tracking would allow them to run a more efficient dispatch process and increase customer satisfaction levels.

The company’s mission is to make video truly social. Users can create contextual conversations with time-specific comments in video, share them with deep links, follow users and favourite comments. It’s about building a community, moment by moment. Comments are synced to a video with a time-stamp so anyone can join the conversation with one tap, whether it’s an hour, a week, a year after the initial video release. It’s been referred to as “second-chance twitter.” Founded on 6th August 2013 by Jo York and Kev Price, who are based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, the idea was taken from concept to market trial in three months as part of the tech accelerator programme Ignite100. Reframed allows people to comment on, share and discuss moments in video. Our mission is to improve the experience and depth in which audiences connect with video content, generating engaging relationships between people who are moved by or resonate with the messages at specific moments. The Reframed interface timestamps comments at the exact moment the user starts typing. This information is used to display the comment at the relevant time in the video, giving them context. The comment activity is displayed visually in graph form over the timeline so users can instantly see the points in the video that are gaining interest and jump straight into those moments.  Users often discuss this activity away from the video on social media sites, which are displayed in the order of the time and date they were made, not at the point in the video to which they refer. So, joining in the conversation becomes more difficult. Reframed syncs the conversation to the video so whether it’s an hour, a week or a month later, people can join in the conversation - in context. In this way Reframed gathers text that describes the content of a video at a specific point. This is very useful for the content owners and also allows Reframed to deliver specific moments within a video in search results. So rather than just displaying the videos that include certain content in the search results, Reframed can deliver the exact moments. Live chat style discussion  Comments also facilitate further discussions, which are displayed outside of the flow of the video due to their size. This provides the functionality to publicly discuss the moments within the video in much more detail. Users can participate in multiple discussion threads at the same time.  And all of the activity around each video is available in “real time”, which means other people’s comments are added to the page without having to refresh it. Comments can be tweeted and a link provided to bring more viewers to the exact point in the video at which the comment was made, known as “deep linking’. Our integration with Twitter goes further, as the entire video also appears in the Twitter timeline and plays from the moment the comment references. This functionality is known as “Twitter Player Cards” and in order to get them you have to apply to Twitter through a very long process. Twitter worked closely with us to speed u p the process and we are in discussion with them about how we can become more deeply integrated, This could include adding replies and retweets around the video and becoming a media partner on their Amplify programme. Platform independent Reframed works with many different video formats, including YouTube, Vimeo, Video.js and self-hosted video. This allows users to comment on and store comments on videos across all these platforms. So whether it’s a TED Talk on YouTube or a documentary on Vimeo, users can keep track of all their comments made on all the videos they have viewed using Reframed. This feature has been described as “Pinterest for moments in video”. Reframed acts as the glue between video, which can be archived and distributed throughout the web and social media platforms. So it’s all abuout what’s current and what’s relevant. Reframed increases engagement, audience reach and monetisation. Channels Channels are a way to group a user’s videos in one place with full moderation tools, which allows the channel owner to promote, hide and edit comments, enabling them to curate interesting videos and influence the conversation. Embeddable player The embeddable player brings all the functionaliy of the Reframed player to any website. The interface can be customised to match the look and feel of any website. Just like the channels, the website owner has full moderation tools to promote, hide and edit comments. Certain accounts can be given “Featured User” priveleges, which allows their comments to take centre stage.","Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Software, Video",2,1-10,"Jo York, Kev Price",3,Seed,2014-12-16,128474,GBP,202333,Seed,128474,GBP,202333,Seed,245974,GBP,397592,245974,GBP,397592,"Northstar Ventures, IP Group, Ignite Accelerator, Hotspur Capital",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
