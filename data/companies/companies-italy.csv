Technology is our enabler for reaching the financially vulnerable. Our open API platform enables fully digital processes not only with insurance companies as is the case with most digital brokers but across the entire value chain thus enabling full transformation and integration of processes.

ToothPic is an official university spin-off of Politecnico di Torino, a major engineering school in Italy and Europe, and is incubated in the university incubator I3P, recently recognized by UBI Global as the best public incubator worldwide.  ToothPic was founded by a team of 4 researchers and professors from Politecnico di Torino, and in 2018 received a seed from VV3TT, an Italian Venture Capital fund dedicated to Technology Transfer from public research. ToothPic technology is protected by 4 patents, and won several prizes in competitions dedicated to startups and twice the Seal of Excellence issued by the European Commission.  ToothPic’s target is the market of authentication systems. Its technology recognizes the unique pattern of invisible imperfections that characterize smartphone cameras to protect cryptographic keys stored on devices, that are commonly used for user authentication, digital signature, blockchain related applications. The additional layer of security represented by this random unclonable feature can be obtained with no additional hardware and related costs.  A Software Development Kit has been developed for Android and iOS. It can be integrated into existing third-party apps and authentication systems, allowing the device possession verification by (de)obfuscating asymmetric cryptographic keys. Users’ credentials are not stored in a centralized service provider server - representing a single point of failure exploitable by an attacker, but they are distributed on users’ devices. Hence, an adversary willing to violate those credentials should target each single user device, facilitating for service providers the migration from an on premises architecture to the cloud, because they don’t need to manage sensitive users credentials, but only their public key.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",1,1-10,Giulio Coluccia,2,Seed,2021-01-19,810000,EUR,983306,Seed,810000,EUR,983306,Seed,1110000,EUR,1349588,1110000,EUR,1349588,"Club degli Investitori, Vertis Venture 3 Tech Transfer",,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,1

It operates across 10 countries with more than 200 customers, including leading hospitality, car rental, and travel brands, who enjoy Manet' solutions as tools capable of generating additional revenue, simplifying daily operations, and increasing the satisfaction and engagement of their customers. The company was founded in 2015 as the brainchild of five young entrepreneurs: Antonio Calia, Marco Barbato, Luca Liparulo, Marco Maisto and Andrea Proietti. The startup was able to raise private capital also thanks to the LVenture Group investment fund (a holding company listed on the MTA of the Italian stock exchange), to its business accelerator LUISS EnLabs (originated from a joint venture with the LUISS University) and to the related network of business angels, leading the startup to attract more than €2 million in investment over time for product and business development. Manet's initial concept relied on a fully customized smartphone designed for hotel, b&b and vacation rental guests, offering free international calls and unlimited Internet connectivity, along with the ability to book all accommodation services directly from the Manet smartphone and take advantage of a whole range of tourist content and services tailored on the destination, such as a travel guide, food and wine suggestions, utility tools (translator, currency exchange, etc.), and the ability to purchase tickets for events, museums and attractions. Starting in 2018, the Manet smartphone evolves into a digital travel assistant also aimed at the car rental industry, to equip car renters with an innovative tool to replace more traditional GPS navigators and Wi-Fi portable routers. Then, in 2020, Manet services are also being made available through the Manet App - directly installable in the travelers' smartphones - in order to offer a fully customized staying experience for hotel guests. The technological advancements in the telecommunications industry leads the company to rethink the original concept in order to develop an even more revolutionary and innovative product. In 2022, the company started rolling out Manet Travel, a connectivity solution based on eSIM (virtual SIM) technology that can bring via an app all the content and services offered on board Manet smartphones directly to the traveler's personal device. Jointly with tour operators, travel agencies, and other travel and tourism players, Manet Mobile Solutions enables travelers from around the world to enjoy a data connectivity package on their personal smartphones thanks to eSIM technology, enabling them to surf the Internet and access the universe of services and content offered by Manet and to enhance their overall abroad travel experience.","Commerce and Shopping, Mobile, Software, Travel and Tourism",6,11-50,"Alessandro Rossi, Andrea Proietti, Antonio Calia, Luca Liparulo, Marco Barbato, Marco Maisto",3,,2018-03-30,1000000,EUR,1232954,Venture - Series Unknown,1000000,EUR,1232954,Venture - Series Unknown,1759000,EUR,2067513,1759000,EUR,2067513,"Italian Angels for Growth, LVenture Group",2,2,2,Made Acquisitions,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,4

Every 7 seconds around the world a person suffers of Acute Brain Damage because of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). They are the most costly and prevalent killers in the last 15 years (15 million deaths by CVD in 2015), and the leading cause of disability (the global incidence rate of TBI is 200 per 100k people per year). WHO estimated a global expenditure of $ 330 billion in 2015, but it is going to increase sharply: $ 4 trillion in 2025 - including premature death, disability, and health care costs - just for CVD in LMICs.  Temperature is a vital body parameter. It regulates all cellular functions so its management is essential for the good outcome of patients in several medical conditions such as cardiac arrest, stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuro and cardiac surgery, epilepsy, migraine and oncology. Regulating body temperature at a desired level makes all other treatments more effective. The most modern medical approach is the target temperature management, where physicians try to maintain the most favourable temperature for the patient for up to 24-36 hours, preventing excessive warming (fever) or cooling. Our device is a targeted temperature management system composed by a THERAPEUTIC COLLAR POWERED BY A SMART CONTROL UNIT (the size of a small briefcase). The collar transforms the neck into a natural heat exchanger exploiting several physiological and anatomical characteristics of the human body. It is quicker to act on brain tissue but can also function as total body temperature adjusting device if required. A disposable protective shield makes cleaning the collar after each use simple while featuring an optimal safety profile both in term of pathogens and allergens. The control unit collects all the data of the treatment and transmits them to the Emergency Response System.  Our mission is to improve the safety of patients on the roadside, at home or in the workplace, and to reduce the costs of chronic care. In fact, Neuron Guard aims to be the only device that can be used in every circumstance, inside and outside the hospital, and allow the user to fully manage the temperature of the patient warming and cooling as necessary.  Our vision is to have a Neuron Guard kit in every public place just like the Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) to empower bystanders to immediately react in case of emergency. Under this perspective our device becomes a connected-intelligent platform that takes care of the patient, connects the scene with the Emergency Response System transmitting vital data to improve the readiness and effectiveness of professional intervention. The device is patented in Italy, USA and China. We have made several prototypes in collaboration with Italian and English companies, such as Tecno Elettra Impianti and TWI, tested it in laboratory and published the experimental results on the NeuroCritical Care Journal. We have also conducted a GAP Analysis with another English consulting firm (CDP) and we are testing the human prototype internally.  We are seeking to raise 2.5M€ to complete the pre-industrialization, with design and construction of the human device for the pilot trial, finalized the regulatory clearance and launch it into the market in 2019.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,1-10,"Enrico Giuliani, Mary Franzese",3,Seed,2021-11-05,650000,EUR,750848,Debt Financing,550000,EUR,635333,Seed,1206000,EUR,1350971,1856000,EUR,2101819,"CDP Venture Capital, Fondo Rilancio Startup, A11 Venture",2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, delivering items to family, friends or strangers requires the services of a courier or of a public agency, that usually are affected by delays, loss of goods or high cost proportioned to the items delivered. Last but not least their inefficiency causes pollution, due to an extra number of vehicles on the road. SiWeGO was created to provide a more efficient service of delivery, by optimizing the resources of professionals and private transporter, i.e. companies and private citizens. Indeed we know, according to European research, that  25% of vehicles on the road, both private and corporate, travel empty. SiWeGO aims to sell these spare spaces of vehicles by connecting who is already on a vehicle and wants to transport with those who want to ship goods. With a real-time matching system, the user can find immediately someone who wants to transport his items; once the good is given to the transporter the sender can constantly track it and chat, thus having everything under control; also the payment can be immediately made online and finally there can be feedback from both sides. On the other side, the transporter is not due to organizing new transport, because he is already on the road and can be detected by the nearer sender. It is easy to understand how this system allows huge saving of time, money and air. SiWeGO works through a platform for web, Android and iOS, equipped with last generation technologies allowing a huge number of links between users: freight transport companies, private citizen-transporter, senders. This is the reason why SiWeGO is highly scalable and replicable. According to its double business model, B2B and B2C, SiWeGO targets two subjects: freight transport companies, which will be asked to buy an annual subscription, and private citizens involved in the delivery market (for example off-site students and workers and frequent E-shoppers) who can download the app for free and pay, if senders, a fee of 9% on the agreed cost of transport. SiWeGO is meant to impact globally thanks to the high scalability of the platform, nevertheless, Italy will be the focus of the first year as the first stage used to acquire users by implementing strong dissemination and marketing actions.","Information Technology, Other, Real Estate, Software, Transportation",1,1-10,Marcello Favalli,3,Seed,2022-12-15,130000,EUR,138304,Pre-Seed,130000,EUR,138304,Pre-Seed,380000,EUR,412190,380000,EUR,412190,"Anonymous Trust, Messaggerie del Garda, Holdinvest, Gruppo Sinergia",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The system was created to solve the cleaning problem in urban contexts directly through the city. Indeed, the mobile robots are little autonomous sweepers, which are able to get around the surroundings whilst collecting waste and avoiding obstacles, both static and dynamic, to then dock inside the bench and be charged thanks to solar energy.  Our aim is to develop an urban space which takes advantage of IoT devices, scattered around the city, to constantly sense and respond to the environment, while collecting useful data that will improve the management of the entire urban realm.  Pixies’s strength is its bottom-up approach to the problem of cleaning within cities, which ensures a very high level of efficiency, since it is a 24/7 on site, quick and sustainable solution. Moreover, thanks to the presence of the smart benches, we will have fixed charging stations directly installed around the city, thus giving a new piece of urban furniture, useful both for the environment and for the citizens. It's important to point out that the implementation of Pixies for cleaning purposes is only the beginning. Please, bear in mind that this system can be used within cities for a thousand other applications (delivery, first aid, mobile charging for vehicles, etc.), always remaining bottom-up, efficient and sustainable because it is embedded with the urban space. The competitive advantage of Pixies is its bottom-up approach to the problem of cleaning. Indeed, Pixies integrates the robots directly into the city, through the use of smart benches as charging bases for them. So far, Pixies has installed the prototype of the robot and the smart bench in the courtyard of the mixed-use building ( residential, hotel and offices) where the company is based, here in Rome, making it active and supervised by ourselves every day.  The system works perfectly. It's able to operate up to 8 hours per day, covering an area of 2'000 sqm, both indoor (300 sqm) and outdoor (1'700 sqm).  As results, the cleaning efficiency has been increased of about 30% and the related cost has been, therefore, reduced of about 40%. Our closest competitors are : Trombia, Enway, Idriverplus, TSM. However, we can also add to these other companies that have developed solutions for the autonomous indoor cleaning. These are, for instance: Fybots,Cyberdyne, Avidbots, Adlatus and Makita.","Hardware, Other, Real Estate, Science and Engineering, Software, Sustainability",3,1-10,"Andrea Saliola, Flavio Ceccarelli, Pier Paolo Ceccaranelli",1,Seed,2021-09-01,180000,EUR,213147,Pre-Seed,180000,EUR,213147,Pre-Seed,180000,EUR,213147,180000,EUR,213147,"Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, Key Capital, LVenture Group",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Once the adoption request has been sent, users will be able to access their own private area where they will be able to monitor the status of their request (online form accepted/rejected, the face-to-face meeting passed/rejected, adoption accepted/rejected). In addition to this, Empethy offers a personalized online consultation service in order to provide an array of useful tips and advice aimed at ""preparing"" the future adopter for a conscious and responsible adoption of the future dog/ cat. On the other hand, animal shelters, rescue groups, volunteers can upload their adoption ads easily and quickly by filling out a standardized online form containing all the information needed for a conscious adoption decision (e.g. personal data, vaccinations/castrations, special needs, pathologies, etc.). Once created their own profiles, associations will be able to access their private area, where they will be able to manage all incoming requests (accept/reject the online form, accept/reject face-to-face meeting, accept/reject adoption) for each individual pet in a more standardized and automated way. Empethy's mission is to encourage responsible pet adoption in order to ensure a long-term relationship between humans and animals and prevent the abandonment of other animals.

The technology enables consumers’ devices to track at high-frequency. In fact, the metrics gathered through this technology are 4 to 20 times more precise than, for instance, the ones of mobile apps that track performance. The flagship product of WHIP is WHIP LIVE, the mobile app that stands as a global community for runners, cyclists and motorcyclists who use WHIP’s technology to support, improve and connect their everyday sports experience. In 2018 WHIP LIVE was launched on the Apple App Store and Android Play Store. In 2020, after consistently improving the app, new for-purchase functions were added. WHIP LIVE is now the ultimate social network for outdoor sports enthusiasts, allowing to track, navigate, plan routes, explore trails and get 24/7 outdoor safety. All this, with the quality of a professional hardware, but with the connectivity and price of an App. WHIP also provides its technology and market intelligence for B2B projects with bike or moto manufacturers, brands, and event organizing committees.

In addition, the advanced versions allow the definition of advertising campaigns in the various digital media channels, building an inventory of channels organized by traffic providers.

The current systems for booking places for private boats in marinas both in the mediterranean and worldwide is outdated and complicated.  There is no one unified system for managing bookings so owners of boats currently have to search for phone numbers of directors of the marina, overcome language and time difference and ring them up to check for and reserve places.  If that marina is full, or the director is difficult to reach, the boat owners have to search again for nearby ports. Marinanow solves this problem by using proven business models from the hotel and home rental industry.  It offers the ability to book online, automatically from any port in the world using one site (a similar concept to sites like hotels.com).  It also allows the “subleasing” of berths that have long term bookings (a similar concept to airbnb).

Most of these people live in rural and isolated areas and have to walk long hours to get the water necessary for the survival of their family. Lack of drinkable water not only endangers people's health, but also takes away a lot of valuable time from women and children who usually take care of the supply. What can we do? With every WAMI bottle, you donate 100 litres of clean water. Thanks to a simple act, you help us build water projects in villages in need and change the world one bottle at a time.  Our water flows down the Italian Alps at 1600 metres above the sea level, from an oligo-mineral source known for its organoleptic properties. By choosing this brand, everyday-water-consumers have the possibility to make the change in the world in an ethical and responsible way.

In particular we are now developing a new innovative sensor for Radon gas detection. Radon is a gas which escapes from the soil and is considered a forerunner for the prediction of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It is also recognized by WHO as a carcinogen, in particular as the second most important factor for the rise of lung cancer, after smoking. Major applications are related to personal dosimetry and environmental monitoring. Solution/Problem offering Radon is an odorless, colorless and tasteless natural gas emitted from the ground and from natural materials commonly used in construction. It is able to accumulate inside homes and workplaces becoming an invisible killer for our health. Radon is a carcinogen earthquakes and volcanic eruption forecasting models. The value proposition of RSens is to produce and market a set of innovative lines of sensors for Radon gas detection, covering the market from the professional side to the consumer one. The same technology can be scaled and used in order to achieve this goal, so these high quality levels are reached also for low-cost devices: - PROFESSIONAL LINE (available) – RStone gas Radon equipment addressed to professional users (radioprotection – radiation experts – construction engineers – geologists); - CONSUMER LINE (R&D) – low cost but accurate sensor for indoor air quality evaluation. Consumer target market; - OEM LINE (R&D) – OEM module  to be integrated into other systems (air conditioning systems – ventilation systems – Building automation). Target Market Opportunity The US market for indoor air quality (indoor air contaminants representing the highest concern in these end-use markets are: mold and other biological contaminants, allergens, airborne pollutants and radon) was valued nearly 7 B$ in 2011 and is projected to reach 7.3 B$ in 2013 and nearly 9.2 B$ in 2017, a five year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% - Equipment segment is expected to account for 3.7 B$ in 2012 and 4.7 B$ in 2017.  Other numbers: U.S. Professional (only U.S. accredited professionals) -> 80 M$ ;	Global market estimation for Professional instruments -> 260 M€. Competitive advantages A novel low noise detector (internally designed) allowed the developing of a lean and low-cost electronics, placing the basis for a cost leadership: 	Proprietary & scalable Technology;		High Performance/Price ratio;	Allow Quick measures – It’s easy to use – Require low maintenance costs;	Due to scale economies it would be possible to spread RSens measurement technology in several products connected with Indoor Air Quality check and remediation. Marketing Strategy Today we are engaged in building the sales network (distributors and resellers in the field of professional instruments for health protection and radiation monitoring) for the RStone professional line. We believe that Indoor Air Quality market will be very important in the early future and that Radon (considered as an important element of the indoor pollution mix) is an important competitive advantage among the actual indoor air quality sensors. The sales and marketing strategy of OEM and Consumer Line calls for support of multinational companies interested in integrate RSens technology inside other commercial products or, in alternative, to be distributed into remote monitoring sensor networks. Business Model The business model will include the outsourcing of the non-strategic production, characterized by high operative fixed costs (mainly fixed assets), and internally maintain the more strategic processes (process that will also allow to RSens the commercial chain control). We will also mantein internally: Strategic production processes: R&D activities and also the assets that will maximize the speed of development; Marketing and communication activities, in order to increase the value of the brand. Management  People with different attitudes and interests compose the management team: L. Bidinelli, President and CEO, is an electric engineer with a postgraduate master in Corporate Finance and Management Control and A. Bosi, VP and Production manager. The technological Advisory Board is composed by Prof. L. Rovati (University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, expert in sensors, Prof. Rovati has already launched another university spin-off, currently very active in its business sector), Prof. G. Verzellesi (University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, expert in radiation detectors and devices) and Prof. G.-F. Dalla Betta (University of Trento, expert in detectors and front-end electronics integration). , electric engineer. The RSens team is composed by 2 employees: Andrea Oleari (Electrical Engineer): Production & R&D Engineer and Elisa Scarduelli (Master degree in languages for business and marketing): Marketing & Sales representative. Searching for RSens is searching for business partners able to support RSens in promoting and distributing Radon sensing technology in the most interesting markets (First in U.S. and Canada, second in Europe and Far East). Main activities to be performed: - Engineering the Consumer Line product for its possible integration with other business product lines; - Marketing and trading effort for promoting & integrating RSens OEM technology inside other mostly known and commercial consumer products (ventilation systems, building automation sensor networks, safety and security networks); - Seeking investors willing to consider a potential investment in the company if the HQs will be moved to the U.S.","Hardware, Health Care, Software",,1-10,,2,Seed,2012-01-01,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,250000,EUR,351836,EIT Digital Accelerator,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
