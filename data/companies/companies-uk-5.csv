Using the SteadyPay mobile app, customers securely link to their bank, we then work out the customer's average income and monitor for when income drops below that average. When this happens we provide a top-up, advancing money to the customer's bank to bring their income back up to average. No interest is charged on the top-up; we are a subscription credit service. By smoothing out income we enable gig economy workers to budget with confidence for everyday essentials, and in turn reduce the need to turn to high-cost credit solutions that trigger debt spirals.","Administrative Services, Apps, Financial Services, Health Care, Information Technology, Lending and Investments, Software",3,11-50,"John Downie, Oleg Mukhanov, Victor Pawley",3,,2023-03-06,3000000,USD,3000000,Venture - Series Unknown,3000000,USD,3000000,Venture - Series Unknown,13397076,USD,13397076,13397076,USD,13397076,"Ascension, Salica, The Future Fund, Launchbay Capital, Ascension Ventures",4,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Using small arrays of speakers and advanced head tracking technologies, immersive 3D Sound will no longer require headphones or speakers located all around a room. We will deliver an unrivalled, authentic and natural audio experience for consumers of immersive Gaming, VR and Movie audio. The AudioScenic system allows a user to experience sounds in a way which is far superior to a conventional loudspeaker system. In a traditional loudspeaker set-up, sound radiates out from the speaker before bouncing off the walls and other objects in the room prior to reaching the ear. What you hear is a mix of the original and reflected sound creating, at best, a distorted ""3D"" effect. In contrast, AudioScenic delivers controlled and independent sound beams direct to the left and right ears. In this way we can create ""virtual headphones"" and deliver spatial audio which simulates sounds positioned in 3D space all around the listener. In addition, our proprietary head tracking technology enables the independent beams of sound to follow the ears of a listener, delivering perfect 3D Sound no matter what position they occupy or whether they move either whilst playing a computer game or watching a movie. Thanks to AudioScenic's technology the ""sweet-spot"" concept belongs to the past. AudioScenic offers solutions for a range of different platforms and a variety of market applications. Our designs use expandable loudspeakers arrays with varying numbers of drivers to create precisely controlled sound beams. AudioScenic works hand-in-hand with our partners and customers to provide the detailed acoustic design support required to implement different products including Home Cinema, Gaming, Simulation, VR and public space audio systems. The AudioScenic Virtua 3D Engine has been ported to leading signal processing platforms. The Virtua Engine uses our patented ultra-efficient signal processing architecture to allow implementation across a range of cost effective systems.

It provides accurate, real-time indication of the product’s freshness with a tactile interface. This time and temperature response is calibrated to different food types to suit food suppliers' requirements.  Globally, a third of food produced is wasted (FAO, 2015), with 60% of it still being safe for consumption. Mimica is creating the next generation of food expiry labelling that reduces food waste and improves safety. We project, based on previous research, that using Bump by Mimica will reduce retail food waste by 50% and home waste by 60%. Based on these estimates and consumption data verified by Mintel and WRAP, we expect Mimica to save up to 13.6 million tonnes of our first three food groups (juice, milk and meat) from landfill per year in European households alone.

Teysha’s platform invention provides the design of synthetic strategies for the development of polymer materials that originate from renewable resources, exhibit novel combinations of strength and toughness, as well as undergo hydrolytic breakdown to biologically-beneficial by-products. The innovation presents a specific application of the inventor’s green polycarbonates platform to develop environmentally friendly polycarbonate materials through scalable synthesis processes. Polyhydroxyl natural products are used as the monomeric building blocks and carbonates, found in common engineering materials, as the linkages. Two classes of polyhydroxyl natural monomers, saccharides and quinic acid, have been tested for the construction of polycarbonates. The transformations of the two natural products can produce a wide range of linear and hyperbranched polymers and copolymers. In one aspect, the invention provides optimisable compositions, structures and architectures of the polycarbonate materials with desired properties to persist in the environment for a useful period of time. In another aspect, the materials can undergo selective degradation into non-harmful substances when exposed to specific natural conditions for a prolonged period of time.

When a healthcare worker uses a Hy-genie station, the system communicates this information back to a dashboard where the user can then compare their hand hygiene compliance against their own performance targets. Working closely with Alder Hey Hospital, Hy-genie has rapidly developed a “lite” system to help healthcare institutions’ fight against COVID-19.

However, only 26% are actually buying from such purpose-driven brands. The reason for this, fundamentally, is that people don't believe that they can make a difference. At Epic Impact we want to change that. We have a vision of a world where every time we spend money, we have a positive impact on humanity, nature and the environment. This is why we have created a new category of lifestyle tool; Personal Impact Management. With a Personal Impact Management solution like Epic's, consumers can better understand, manage and improve the impact that they have on the world around them. Through our mobile app, consumers can: - Let us know what values are important to them, to personalise their Epic Impact experience - Explore a directory of vetted ethical, sustainable merchants, covering categories such as clothing & accessories, homeware, renewable energy, food, and holidays. - Earn real-time, automated rewards whenever they make a purchase from an Epic Impact Rewards merchant. - Use those rewards to donate to charities or offset carbon emissions. - Track the contribution their day-to-day spending make towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For merchants, Epic Impact provides: - a no-code integration rewards platform for e-commerce and epos systems that can connect to over 550 solutions, including Shopify, Squarespace, Magento 2, WooCommerce and WIX, and be launched in minutes. - a loyalty rewards platform designed to build values-based relationship with their customers, from exclusive offers, to gift cards, to interactive digital receipts. There is, understandably, a lot of focus on the major issue of climate change and carbon emissions, which is driving an increase in top-down solutions that aim to help consumers reduce their carbon footprint. However, for the majority of consumers, when it comes to the moment of purchase, it is convenience and affordability that are the primary concern, not the carbon footprint of their purchase. Furthermore, being carbon neutral will become as mandatory for merchants as having a website and a social media presence, so what will cause long-term loyalty with companies that have purpose at their core? The answer lies in the alignment of values between merchant and consumer, such as ocean conservation, wildlife protection, the reduction in people suffering hunger and living in poverty. Where Epic Impact differs is that we are taking a bottom up approach, focusing on empowering consumers to support the causes that they care about when they shop. Then, through a growing network effect, this momentum of buying better will support not just reducing carbon emissions, but also creating a cleaner, fairer world for all of humanity, nature and the environment.","Commerce and Shopping, Other, Sales and Marketing, Social Impact, Sustainability",2,1-10,"Grant Calton, James Brown",3,Seed,2021-03-01,140000,GBP,195005,Seed,140000,GBP,195005,Seed,535000,GBP,718688,535000,GBP,718688,"Startupbootcamp Australia, Tenity, Nigel Wray, Ironbridge Capital Partners, Curt Hopkins",2,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm Mohan Lath, a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) living in the UK. Like all my NRI, Person of Indian Origin (PIO) and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) friends, I use various India linked products to maintain my connections to India, e.g. NRI bank accounts, NRI fixed deposits, NRI home loan, money transfer to India, calling cards/SIM cards, etc.   However, I always struggled to find an easy way to gather and organise information from a myriad of sources on and off-line that would help me make smart decisions. I had to search through many websites or speak to my friends and family to compare rates, fees and features before identifying the best service to use.  I also found that many other NRIs I spoke to were time-poor and just simply chose the service provider based on Brand awareness or word-of-mouth recommendations, this often led to them losing out on the best value for their money because not all the biggest or best-known companies offered the best deals. That’s when I created NriDealExpert.com as a way for the Indian overseas community to get unbiased listings of India-linked products and services that they can compare and choose, all in one place. I wanted to offer a way that the NRI community could get value and give back by rating and reviewing the service providers, that way it would become a marketplace for the people, for the people.  The website helps you compare prices, features and reviews for NRO or NRE savings accounts, NRI home loans, NRO or NRE fixed deposits, Money transfers to India, India calling plans, etc. The site is constantly updated with the latest information and is expected to grow over time with an expanded list of products and additional countries.

This prompted us to think about how we might go about changing this and adding to our current broker-style offering. In short, Otimo will be creating a black-box-style app using the software that already exists within the phone. We will be implementing the app for both the teaching and learning of driving. Otimo is completely non-intrusive and will not change how an instructor has to teach, nor how a learner learns. It will work in the background of each journey, tracking, scoring and flagging key events that occur throughout. Once each drive is done, the route will be overlaid with the key events and a driving score. This is then a new, fun and engaging way for instructors to give feedback to the learners of today. Beyond the driver training industry, we see the implementation of telematics to the broader motoring industry in a gamified way - think Strava but for safe driving. We believe we can aid road safety and improve the standard of driving across the board with an activity-based social media platform.
