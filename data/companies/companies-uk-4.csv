According to Deloitte, it is one of the UK’s fastest-growing tech startups, and in both 2022 and 2023 the Financial Times ranked Popsa in the Top 20 fastest-growing software companies in the whole of Europe.  Popsa is developing generative AI technology and AI agents that generate personalised products for consumers based on the data contained in their own photos, therefore removing countless anxieties and manual tasks usually associated with personalisation, and empowering everyday people with professional storytelling techniques for the first time. Its award-winning app has made printing memories so easy and accessible that anyone can do it. As a result, the company receives 18,000 orders every week, increasing to 80,000 during Q4. Popsa's native iOS and Android apps are available in 12 languages – attracting more than 8 million users to date – and they ship to 50 countries around the world. Only 15% of Popsa’s revenue comes from the UK (France is their top market whilst the US is the fastest growing). People come to Popsa to create photobooks and other products, but what Popsa really does is help them process their lives and relationships through reflection on their photos.  The company's longer term ambition is to become a global destination; a space to explore all of life’s moments and the emotions that come with them – not just the highlights. So holidays, but also lazy days and sad days too.

Currently focussed on the prospecting and exploration stages, it ultimately aims to extract, process and utilise the materials embedded within some of the millions of Near Earth and Main Belt Asteroids. We are first and foremost a business. We aim to extract resources from asteroids to boost the Earth's economy and kick start the Space Based Economy as the vast values of some asteroids can be valued in trillions, with the largest asteroids being worth quintillions, while even small asteroids can be hugely valuable. This money will be spent in building ever growing amounts of space infrastructure so that we can eventually allow all humans who desire it to live and work in Space. Our team is currently working in partnership with the Space Robotics Lab at Tohoku University, Japan, developing SCAR-E. These low-cost, ruggedised, walking and climbing robots will be capable of undertaking asteroid, planetary and lunar exploration, alongside mining operations.   Designed to withstand exposure to radiation, high accelerations experienced during space launch, and extreme temperatures, SCAR-E will be capable of in-orbit asset maintenance such as spacewalking and extravehicular activity.

Outfield is a precision orchard management system that provides growers with fruit counts and year round variability maps. By providing key insights on orchard performance, we help growers become more efficient, more profitable, and more environmentally friendly.  Yield estimates are crucial for all aspects of fruit growing, from maximising orchard production to agreeing sales contracts. Growers estimate yields manually based on around 0.5% of their trees. The unreliable and limited data they collect leads to 20% average errors in estimated yield per orchard. This reduces output, efficiency and profit while increasing environmental damage. Outfield growers have less than 10% error in their yield estimates. Our growers use inexpensive off-the-shelf drones, loaded with flight plans from Outfield. At the touch of a button, they make a 30-minute automated drone flight covering thousands of trees. The images are sent to Outfield’s cloud based platform and processed using bespoke image recognition algorithms. Maps and insights are returned to growers within 24hrs. This strategy allows Outfield to deploy a scalable SAAS model. Our fruit-level data platform has been developed and trialled with apple and pear growers on 3 continents, and our MVP is being used right now by paying beta-test growers in the UK, New Zealand, and South Africa. Growers have praised the unparalleled flexibility, speed and ease of drone data acquisition. We are now looking for investment to drive our growth and to scale our product to meet the growing demand. Our team is ready to build and expand international presence, to broaden our service offering with new product features, and to move into new market segments in other fruit crops.  We are entering the 4th agricultural revolution and Outfield is perfectly positioned at the convergence of machine learning, cloud computing, agritech and drone technologies. Join Outfield in reducing fruit waste, unlocking orchards value, and driving the future of fruit farming.","Agriculture and Farming, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software",2,1-10,"Jim McDougall, Oliver Hilbourne",10,,2024-05-01,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,750000,GBP,1035829,2059557,GBP,2652799,"Innovate UK, Deeptech Labs, Low Carbon Innovation Fund, Amadeus, South East Angels",2,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,1

Gameway empowers users to enjoy discovering the best games on their phone through simplifying the way mobile gaming content is presented to them. Additionally Gameway is set to provide game developers with new tools to enhance their work and increase engagement with fans across the globe. Our Challenge: Mobile gaming is growing at a phenomenal rate with over 1000 games released per week across Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store. There are 3.4 million apps and games currently available on the Play Store store alone. With so much choice, it’s no wonder it takes users between 15-60 minutes to manually find a game they may be interested in. Even when a user does find a game, 72% are uninstalled after being played just twice. By using an app store, users see less than 1% of the games available to them, the majority of these from the large studios with bigger marketing budgets. Why Now: Another 1 billion people are expected to gain access to the internet in the next 3 years through mobile. Growing up truly mobile-first they’ll discover all their entertainment, including games via their phones. Mobile gaming has reached the point of max-saturation, the app stores are overfilled and advertising is pulling customers in every direction to download games. The recent growth of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, combined with the mass scaling and low cost architectures provided by Amazon and Google, now allow for extremely personalised experiences, distributed across mobile phones around the world in any language.","Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Gaming, Hardware, Mobile, Science and Engineering, Software",2,1-10,"Benjamin Woolf, Samuel Koch",3,Seed,2019-09-21,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,68000,GBP,81873,"Stadia Ventures, Startup Sesame",,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2

A difference, for example, that can allow an eye surgery to become a outpatient event. MicroSpray technologies are making this a reality by decreasing the size of the drugs into uniform microspheres, which you can then inject into the eye with the smallest gauge needle rather than a more invasive tool. Currently, biopharmaceutical industries use costly chemical methods to manufacture microspheres, which rely on batch-type processes, have a low throughput and produce non-uniform particles. MicroSpray Technologies is developing a spray-manufacturing system which enables reproducible, tight and uniform control of particle size. Allowing clinicians to administer control over the rate at which drugs are delivered to patients, using novel slow release particle technologies.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",1,1-10,Salman Malik,1,Seed,2018-06-22,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,"SOSV, RebelBio",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
