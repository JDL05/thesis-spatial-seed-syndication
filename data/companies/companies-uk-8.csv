This process is cumbersome for customers, detrimental for both retailers' profitability and the environment and urgent to solve. We, at DeepGears, are developing a software aiming at solving this problem. With Deepgears, online shoppers can: ● 	Visualize how garments truly fit on their virtual character, featuring their very same body measurements ● 	Find out their perfect size ●     Discover DeepGears’ recommended products, empowered by advanced analytics on users’ physical trait data As a result, online consumers will shop online more easily, enjoying an experience closer to reality and ultimately return fewer unwanted items. Drawing from a successful Shopify’s case study on accessories, we have estimated that products equipped with DeepGears' software will experience a 20+% sales increase and 30+% reduction in returns. This will not only constitute an attractive value proposition to any retailer, but also reduce the immense amount of CO2 produced by the fashion industry.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Design, Hardware, Software",2,1-10,"Giulio Capodimonti, Pietro Dalpane",2,Seed,2022-03-03,250000,USD,250000,Seed,250000,USD,250000,Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,"APX, Newchip Accelerator",,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Retailers have to react to the markets in real-time, as there is more information available for consumers meaning they can make decisions about what to buy instantly. The amount of data available has increased online exponentially, which is new to the trade. Capturing this and analysing it is something they grapple with daily. Retailers carry out competitor and market analysis to: learn what is going on in the industry, monitor their closest competitors, gather inspiration, and understand trends to aid them with their offer. They currently do this manually and do not have an effective tool to help them do this. Bolda is a tool that aids retailers to make the right decisions, whether reacting to pricing and promotions, analysing styles and finishes or spotting emerging retailers in the market. Other retail industries currently use technologies like these and Bolda aims to bring this to the furniture and homeware industry, using our unique insight into retailers and brands.
