Unfortunately, misdiagnoses of cardiovascular disease (CD) are all too common in pre-specialist settings. Often, the first test to investigate the heart of a potential CD patient is an electrocardiogram (ECG) performed and analyzed by non-specialists. But what if these healthcare professionals had access to a tool that could make interpreting ECGs easy and accurate? Our survey of health professionals revealed that less than half felt confident interpreting ECGs, 60% found it difficult to diagnose based on ECG recordings and only 2% trusted the suggestions from their current device. HATO utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in real-time and provide accurate and timely diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases. Our agnostic software solution utilizes deep learning to quickly identify and understand abnormalities in the heart, and agnostic software provides healthcare professionals with a real-time view of the patient's heart to assist in locating abnormalities and reacting quickly in critical situations.

Adenium focuses on the development and commercialization of novel antibiotics for the treatment of multi drug resistant bacterial infections. Our  focus is treatment of nosocomial infections, in particular complicated urinary tract infections and hospital or ventilator acquired pneumonia caused by multi drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria.  Complicated urinary tract infections are caused by predominantly Gram-negative bacteria and in particular Escherichia coli. E. coli is also a frequent cause of many other common bacterial infections such as  cholecystitis, bacteremia, cholangitis and traveler’s diarrhea, as well as other clinical infections such as neonatal meningitis and pneumonia. Most Infections caused by Escherichia coli are relative easy to cure, however, hospital adapted strains of Escherichia coli are often multi-resistant and are able to cause life threatening infections. Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator acquired pnemonia (VAP) are also indications dominated by Gram-negative bacteria and in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. P. aeruginosa has become an important cause of infection, especially in patients with compromised host defense mechanisms. It is the most common pathogen isolated from patients who have been hospitalized longer than 1 week and it is a frequent cause of nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, UTIs, and bacteremia. Infections caused by Klebsiella and Pseudomonas are complicated since many Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains are multi drug resistant. Infections caused by Acinetobacter are rare and most strains found outside hospitals are sensitive to antibiotics. While Acinetobacter poses few risks to healthy individuals, a few species, particularly Acinetobacter baumannii, can cause serious infections – mainly in very ill trauma and hospitalized patients increasing the post trauma mortality as seen in wounded soldiers in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The most common Acinetobacter infections include pneumonia, bacteraemia, wound infections, and urinary tract infections. ‘Hospital-adapted’ strains of Acinetobacter are often resistant to antibiotics and are increasingly difficult to treat. Adenium Biotech strives to find a novel treatment for multi-resistant Acinetobacter. Arenicin is a non haemolytic and non cytotoxic 21 amino acids antimicrobial peptide isolated from the lugworm. Arenicin has a strong and selective efficacy against Gram negative bacteria as well as a broad therapeutic window. Ten Arenicin variants were selected and subjected to a ranking program consisting of toxicology as well as in vitro and in vivo efficacy profiling. The three highest ranking Arenicin variants were selected in December 2013 for final lead optimization and selection of an Arenicin lead product candidate early in the fourth quarter 2013. Adenium Biotech is a semi-virtual biotech company with a small group of experts that supported by an international scientific advisory board focus on bringing the Arenicin program through clinical development to NDA filing.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,1-10,,2,,2012-06-07,11000000,DKK,1861644,Venture - Series Unknown,11000000,DKK,1861644,Venture - Series Unknown,11000000,DKK,1861644,11000000,DKK,1861644,"Novo Holdings, Sunstone Life Science Ventures",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
