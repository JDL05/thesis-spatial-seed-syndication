We are a Product Performance Management (PPM) platform, helping retailers improve performance by unlocking the full potential of their product data. We connect product-level data from across a retailer's channels to their product inventory, offering visibility into their dynamic campaigns. From there, they can use that visibility to gain control over which products they're promoting by organising campaigns around specific segments, like ""best-seller products"" (the 15%-20% generating the most revenue).  Our platform can capture Google Shopping trends, product margins, and return rates, can identify new products, deadstock, or any custom product-level data, and enhances Facebook algorithms to deliver tangible success, resulting in positive ROI. We unlock collaboration between the marketing and merchandising departments by helping Category Managers to understand the ad spend and marketing performance of every product, automatically recommend the right products for promotion. By achieving positive ROI with global brands such as Marks & Spencer, Magalu, and Farfetch, and continuously working on replicating our success, we grow our pool of validated use cases that deliver positive ROI and scale ad spend with a high degree of confidence. ►Meta Business Partner ►Google Premier Partner","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Information Technology, Platforms, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,51-100,Karel Schindler,3,Early Stage Venture,2018-09-25,4400000,EUR,5175862,Series A,4400000,EUR,5175862,Series A,5670068,USD,5670068,5670068,USD,5670068,"KAYA, Agora SA, Accelerasia Ventures",1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,5
