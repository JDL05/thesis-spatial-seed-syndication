We provide intelligent pricing for the hospitality industry, helping hotels maximize revenue with an automatic and self-learning software that detects opportunities and takes immediate actions.  Climber taps into a hotel’s existing reservation system and puts its machine learning to work by not only considering the historical data of the hotel but also the market demand (air traffic, local events, weather forecast, online reputation). We have an exceptional team of 14 strong individuals (9 nationalities) with complimentary skills from Data Science, Engineers, Sales to Marketing.  Everyone is operating in-person from our offices in Lisbon. A complimentary mix of hustling, Revenue Management expertise and Data Science/Mathematicians. There is a growing demand for accommodation globally and that's particularly obvious in most city hotels who are often fully booked. Managing the existing inventory and maximizing the profit is a key challenge of small hotel chains today since technology has had limited impact. From the software stack perspective a hotel typically should use three types of software (PMS + Channel Manager + RMS) and we understood that for hotels that have the need to optimize their revenue it's impossible without data driven software. We understood as well that there is a big gap in the hotel space since small hotel chains don't have access to accessible Revenue Management Systems. Due to the lack of financial capacity and know-how on how to use the current complex and expensive Revenue management systems on the market, small hotel chains end up doing daily analysis on spreadsheets that are both time-consuming and information-poor resulting in making decisions that leave hotels running below their full revenue potential.  Climber tackle the needs of small hotel chains by providing an accessible solution that is easy to use, fast to integrate and automated, replacing the manual labor on daily analysis and reporting that before was costing the hotels a massive amount of time.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software, Travel and Tourism",2,11-50,"Joao Feliciano, Mario Mouraz",5,Seed,2019-11-12,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,541928,USD,541928,541928,USD,541928,"TheVentureCity, Seedrs, Loyal VC, Innovation Nest, Startup Lisboa",2,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Affordable, disposable diagnostic cartridges will be produced in large scale and shipped via global distributors. The team behind the company has world class experience in biotechnology, electronics and physics, with a proven track record in managing start-ups. Magnomics has a Letter of Intent from a leading dairy company and won the 2015 Kansas City Animal Health Investment Forum innovation award, as well as the Ag Biotech Entrepreneurial Showcase award in North Carolina in 2016. €1.6M in seed financing have been raised through grants and investments. Magnomics is seeking €1.5M to conclude the prototyping of its first product in the animal health space.  Technology: Magnomics technology stands on four patent families, with more in the pipeline, and has been published over twenty times in prestigious scientific journals. Magnomics provides a portable and affordable PCR device that requires no training to operate. The product integrates sample preparation, amplification and DNA detection within a single cartridge using microfluidics, making use of a novel magnetoresistive DNA sensing technology.  Market: The veterinary diagnostics market is hungry for innovation and has low regulatory barriers. This market is estimated at €4 billion, with an 8.6% expected growth for the period 2016 to 2021. Magnomics will focus on the detection of bovine mastitis - an inflammation of the dairy cow’s mammary gland, whose treatment depends on the bacteria involved. This ailment causes over €30 billion in annual losses for producers worldwide. In the initial target markets (North America, Europe and Brazil), there are 56 million dairy cows with an average mastitis base incidence 30%. Given a €25 price tag and some segmentation, this amounts to a serviceable market of close to €300M, in which a penetration of 10-15% is expectable. The product can be sold either directly to farmers or to veterinarians: strategic partnerships are being negotiated with large pharma/dairy players to ensure market access. Competition: Companies such as AAD, DeLaval, and PortaCheck already have on-site solutions, which include California Mastitis Tests (CMT), Somatic Cell Counters and variants (SCC), as well as lateral flow strips. These current on-site diagnostics tools indicate the presence of an infection but are unable to determine the pathogen, which is key to define an appropriate treatment. Culture testing (e.g. Idexx, Virbac) is the current benchmark and is being tried on site as well: although cheap, the added value is greatly diminished due to long waiting times and difficulties in setting up a working protocol. Finally, laboratories provide fast molecular solutions (e.g. ThermoFisher) that are fast but expensive, while requiring complicated logistics due to sample collection that increase lead times. Magnomics will bring these molecular solutions to the farm in a convenient and affordable product.

In fact, Followprice is a high quality lead generator for e-commerce stores, taking consumers back to the store, and increase the sales of the online store. We are solving a problem both for consumers and online retailers. On one hand, consumers are reluctant on registering/leaving their email as they are often tired of receiving newsletters and mass mail.  Furthermore, they don’t have a structured and automatic way to be aware of the price changes of their favorite products. At the same time, online retailers don’t have the ability to communicate with their website visitors when they don’t buy or register. In fact, online retailers are spending millions of euros to take consumers to their website, but 90% of these leave no trace, thus being untraceable. Followprice appears as a solution for these problems. For consumers we will not only provide the service of warning about price changes, as we will be SPAM free, as they will only receive notifications about the specific products they are following. For online retailers we will provide a valuable service, by taking interested consumers (high quality leads) back to their website. Followprice is an online platform that provides a “follow price button”, to be integrated on webstores. The Followprice button will be on the page of each product, allowing consumers that click on it to add the product to their Followprice List. Whenever a product in their Followprice List changes its price, all consumers following the product are automatically notified on Facebook or Email. The Followprice List can be accessible through our website (followprice.co), were consumers can see and manage all the products they are following from several stores. In the future, consumers will be able to organize the list as they wish, and even share folders of products with their friends. When consumers click either on the notification or on product on the Followprice List, they are redirected to the product page of the e-commerce store.  Our customers (online retailers) benefit from Followprice as we bring back to their website highly interested consumers, that otherwise would not probably go back there. We are a high quality lead generator for online retailers, not bring new consumers, but bringing consumers that had been on the store at least for one time. We will provide online retailers not only with the service of automatically notifying interested consumers on price changes of the products of their store, but also provide them advanced statistics, social media brand awareness and also the feature of creating specialized notifications (not automatic).","Apps, Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Design, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",7,11-50,"Gonçalo Mendes, Gonçalo Mendes, Joao Almeida Leitao, João Andrade, João Andrade, Vasco Moreira, Vasco Moreira",2,Seed,2016-06-01,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,645000,EUR,746169,645000,EUR,746169,"LC Ventures, Portugal Ventures, Startup Braga",1,3,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
