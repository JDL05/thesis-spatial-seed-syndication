InPlanet,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/inplanet,Active,,"Agriculture, Environmental Consulting, Forestry","München, Bayern, Germany",The world’s first certified Enhanced Rock Weathering carbon credits — removing gigatons of CO₂ while regenerating tropical soils.,"20,282","European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",80939,$1M to $10M,2022-08-01,month,,,,,For Profit,https://www.inplanet.earth/,https://x.com/inplanet_earth,https://www.facebook.com/inplanetearth/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/inplanetearth/,"InPlanet and Isometric announce the first-ever delivery of verified Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) carbon removal credits.  Carbon dioxide removal credits were developed and provided by InPlanet, verified by Isometric, delivered to Adyen, and facilitated by ClimeFi. This milestone advances the voluntary carbon market by introducing a new format of high-quality, permanent carbon removal credits for the rapidly expanding global marketplace. In natural rock weathering, carbon dioxide dissolved in water reacts with elements in rocks, forming a bicarbonate that is securely stored in oceans for over 10,000 years. Enhanced Rock Weathering accelerates this natural carbon removal process by crushing rocks into a very fine powder and spreading them on farmland, to ensure durable carbon removal at scale. Such durability is critical for climate change mitigation as traditional approaches that focus on organic carbon sinks (e.g. forestation) are at risk of storage failure (reversal) as a consequence of climate change, disease or land use change.  Enhanced Rock Weathering offers several advantages, including relatively low cost, scalability, and substantial co-benefits such as improved soil health, greater agricultural productivity, and job creation in rural communities. Moreover, the durability offered by ERW minimizes the risk of future re-release. However, the prior lack of rigorous monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) has hindered the commercialization of this approach.  These first ERW credits, delivered by InPlanet and verified by Isometric’s Enhanced Weathering Protocol, show it is possible to do scientifically rigorous MRV on open systems carbon removal pathways and raise the bar for quality in the EW market. Isometric’s protocol requires direct measurements and statistical confirmation that the weathering process has removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, ensuring that each credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide durably removed.  Brazil: an ideal setting for scaling carbon removal and soil restoration InPlanet is the first carbon removal company to work with the unique conditions of tropical soils to conduct ERW. These credits correspond to their recent deployment at the “Serra da Mantiqueira” project, located in São Paulo State, Brazil, where InPlanet works with local farmers to restore soils and help them to transition to low carbon, sustainable and nature-based agriculture.  With Brazil’s unique conditions, InPlanet projects benefit from an ideal setting for scalable carbon removal. The country’s abundant basalt deposits allow for efficient, sustainable sourcing and transport, and its tropical climate, with high temperatures and heavy rainfall, accelerates the carbon sequestration process compared to temperate regions. This favorable context makes ERW more effective and also brings immediate benefits to farmers, such as enhancing soil health, increasing crop yields and reducing reliance on fertilizers—thereby supporting a sustainable and resilient agricultural future.  “At InPlanet, we’re transforming enhanced rock weathering into a scalable climate solution by partnering with farmers across the tropics,” said Felix Harteneck, Founder & CEO at InPlanet. “In just two years, we’ve established ourselves as one of the most trusted and scientifically rigorous CDR companies worldwide. Now, as we see our vision becoming reality, we’re positioned to remove gigatons of CO₂ , while empowering agricultural communities to build a more resilient future.” Isometric-verified data from InPlanet’s credits will be anonymized and shared with Cascade Climate, a philanthropic organization advancing scientific rigor in EW. The data will feed into Cascade’s Data Quarry—the first-ever EW data sharing system—which will give researchers the opportunity to access verified commercial data for the advancement of ERW models and other solutions to scale the field. Eamon Jubbawy, Isometric Founder and CEO, said: “These world-first Enhanced Weathering (EW) credits are a key step to scaling carbon removal. They bring an unprecedented level of scientific rigor to a pathway that has great potential, but which has lacked robust verification until now. The transparent data behind these credits shows that Isometric’s high quality, verified EW credits represent a tonne of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere and should be a key part of every CDR buyer’s portfolio.” Paolo Piffaretti, Co-Founder & CEO of ClimeFi, said: “At ClimeFi, our mission is to provide organisations with access to high-quality, permanent carbon removals. The delivery of the world’s first CDRs from EW is a breakthrough moment, proving that innovative carbon removal technologies can be brought to market at scale. We are proud to have facilitated this first-of-its-kind collaboration, helping Adyen take a significant step towards their climate goals.” The next frontier for the voluntary carbon market These first ERW credits prove this natural carbon removal process can safely accelerate to a human-relevant time and scale. Early purchases from catalytic buyers such as Frontier (Stripe & Shopify), Milkywire (Klarna & WRLD Foundation), and Klimate were critical in enabling InPlanet’s first deployments and bringing ERW from the lab to the field to the market. Future deployments and MRV will build on the learnings of these first credits, creating a turning point for carbon markets. Buyers, suppliers and policymakers can view the transparent data behind every ERW credit on the Isometric Registry. The Registry provides a permanent audit trail for all credits issued by Isometric and makes all the underlying information behind every credit public so the data can be reviewed and scrutinized. About InPlanet InPlanet is a carbon removal pioneer scaling Enhanced Weathering (EW) technology within the unique conditions of tropical agricultural lands.

As a result, the learning journey can be tailored to each child's developmental stage.","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Software",2,51-100,"Franziska Meyer, Irene Klemm",5,Early Stage Venture,2024-08-28,,,,Convertible Note,10500000,EUR,11201888,Series A,13850000,EUR,15011784,13850000,EUR,15011784,"FJ Labs, AENU, DN Capital, b2venture, Emerge",2,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The TREEO carbon product can be split into two main steps: carbon capture and carbon storage. Trees capture CO2 from our atmosphere and store it as carbon while releasing the oxygen we breathe. Through the TREEO technology, we empower tree growers in the Global South and finance reforestation and restoration projects. We then guarantee the carbon is stored in the long term with harvested wood products and biochar. TREEO guarantees full transparency through our single-tree monitoring technology. Solving the climate crisis requires scalable and inclusive carbon removal solutions. For millions of smallholder farmers, climate finance is currently inaccessible. To monetize their carbon removals, they need reliable and easy-to-use monitoring technologies, required for transparency and trust. It is our mission to provide farmers with exactly that: A single-tree monitoring technology, empowering local communities to generate verified carbon removals and connecting them to the global carbon market. With these partnerships and the TREEO Technology, we can then provide companies transparent CDRs to live up to their corporate responsibility with the data to prove their impact.","Agriculture and Farming, Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software, Sustainability",3,11-50,"Johannes Schwegler, Stefan Ferber, Tomáš Vítek",3,,2024-09-25,1720380,EUR,1914722,Equity Crowdfunding,1720380,EUR,1914722,Equity Crowdfunding,4570380,EUR,5070812,4570380,EUR,5070812,"SAIS, Kreissparkasse Ludwigsburg, Sparkassenbeteiligungs-gesellschaften, Oswald, Ulrich Bosch",,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a legislative change, the GHG quota allows owners of electric vehicles to certify and market saved CO2 emissions from their electric vehicles and public charging facilities. The legislation assumes that a vehicle that is purely battery electric and not powered by fossil fuels will save C02 in transport per year. For calendar year 2022, this calculation was 864 kg of CO2 per e-vehicle and for 2023, 702 kg of CO2 per e-vehicle. The certification body for the annual CO2 savings of a vehicle is the Federal Environment Agency. Buyers of these CO2 certificates are so-called quota obligated companies, i.e. mineral oil companies based in Germany or Austria. mint future GmbH offers the service of application, certification and marketing both in the context of B2C (via the brand wirkaufendeinethg.de) and in the context of B2B2C; as a provider of white label solutions. With the white label solution for the GHG quota, mint future supplies over 150 companies and, derived from this, over 300 white label partners. The SaaS solution is used by insurance groups, by public utilities, but also by bodyshops or car dealership groups.  The customer-oriented white-label platform for handling the GHG quota also offers users of mint future after-sales around electromobility. In addition, the web application allows users to invest parts of the proceeds from CO2 trading in sustainable projects.  mint future GmbH gives drivers of electric vehicles and operators of public charging infrastructure access to sustainable GHG trading via the white label platform and creates incentives for a rethink in the mobility sector in cooperation with the Federal Environment Agency. Mint future offers end-to-end solutions to enable companies, such as private persons, to monetize CO2 savings while at the same time trade environmental commodities.","Advertising, Energy, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Software, Sustainability, Transportation",1,1-10,Maximilian Stein,2,Seed,2023-12-08,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,"1750 Ventures, TÖNNJES INTERNATIONAL GROUP GmbH",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
